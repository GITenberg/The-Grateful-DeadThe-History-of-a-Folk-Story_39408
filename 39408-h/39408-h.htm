<p class="first">The combination of narrative themes is so frequent a
phenomenon in folk and formal literature that one almost forgets to
wonder at it. Yet in point of fact the reason for it and the means by
which it is accomplished are mysteries past our present comprehension.
If we could learn how and where popular tales unite, if we could
formulate any general principle of union or severance, we should be
well on the way to an understanding of the riddle which has hitherto
baffled all students of narrative, namely, the diffusion of stories. We
have theories enough; our immediate need is for more studies of
individual themes, careful and, if it must be, elaborate discussions of
many well-known cycles. Happily, these are accumulating and give
promise of much useful knowledge at no distant day.</p>
<p>One principle has become clear. Since motives are so frequently
found in combination, it is essential that the complex types be
analyzed and arranged, with an eye kept single nevertheless to the
master-theme under discussion. Collectors, both primary and subsidiary,
have done such valiant service that the treasures at our command are
amply sufficient for such studies, so extensive, indeed, that the task
of going through them thoroughly has become too great for the
unassisted student. It cannot be too strongly urged that a single theme
in its various types and compounds must be made predominant in any
useful comparative study. This is true when the sources and analogues
of any literary work are treated; it is even truer when the bare motive
is discussed.</p>
<p><i>The Grateful Dead</i> furnishes an apt illustration of the
necessity of such handling. It appears in a variety of different
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e348" href="#xd20e348" name=
"xd20e348">x</a>]</span>combinations, almost never alone. Indeed, it is
so widespread a tale, and its combinations are so various, that there
is the utmost difficulty in determining just what may properly be
regarded the original kernel of it, the simple theme to which other
motives were joined. Various opinions, as we shall see, have been held
with reference to this matter, most of them justified perhaps by the
materials in the hands of the scholars holding them, but none quite
adequate in view of later evidence. The true way to solve the riddle
appears to be this: we must ask the question,&mdash;what is the
residuum when the tale is stripped of elements not common to a very
great majority of the versions belonging to the cycle? What is left
amounts to the following,&mdash;the story reduced to its lowest terms,
I take it.</p>
<p>A man finds a corpse lying unburied, and out of pure philanthropy
procures interment for it at great personal inconvenience. Later he is
met by the ghost of the dead man, who in many cases promises him help
on condition of receiving, in return, half of whatever he gets. The
hero obtains a wife (or some other reward), and, when called upon, is
ready to fulfil his bargain as to sharing his possessions.</p>
<p>Nowhere does a version appear in quite this form; but from what
follows it will be seen that the simple story must have proceeded along
some such lines. The compounds in which it occurs show much variety. It
will be necessary to study these in detail, not merely one or two of
them but as many as can be found. Despite the bewildering complexities
that may arise, I hope that this method of approach may throw some new
light on the wanderings of the tale.</p>
<p>Of my debt to various friends and to many books, though indicated in
the body of the work, I wish to make general and grateful
acknowledgment here. My thanks, furthermore, are due to the librarians
of Harvard University for their courteous hospitality; to Professor G.
L. Kittredge for his generous encouragement to proceed with this study,
though he himself, as I found after most of my material was collected,
had undertaken it several years before I began; and to Professor R. K.
Root for his help in reading the proofs. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To Karl Simrock is due the honour of discovering the
importance of <i>The Grateful Dead</i> for the student of literature
and legend. In his little book, <i lang="de">Der gute Gerhard und die
dankbaren Todten</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e371src" href=
"#xd20e371" name="xd20e371src">1</a> he called attention to the theme
as a theme, and treated it with a breadth of knowledge and a clearness
of insight remarkable in an attempt to unravel for the first time the
mixed strands of so wide-spread a tale. Using the Middle High German
exemplary romance, <i lang="de">Der gute Gerhard</i>, as his point of
departure, he examined seventeen other stories, all but two of which
have the motive well preserved.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e377src"
href="#xd20e377" name="xd20e377src">2</a> Unhappily, the versions which
he found came from a limited section of Europe, most of them from
Germanic sources. Thus he was led to an interpretation of the tale on
the basis of Germanic mythology. This, though ingenious enough and very
erudite, need not detain us. It was done according to a fashion of the
time, which has long since been discarded. Simrock took the essential
traits of the theme to be the burial of the dead and the ransom from
captivity.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e383src" href="#xd20e383" name=
"xd20e383src">3</a> &ldquo;<span lang="de">Wo nur noch eine von beiden
das Thema zu bilden scheint</span>,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;<span lang=
"de">da hat die Ueberliefertung gelitten.</span>&rdquo; Here again he
was misled by the narrow <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2"
name="pb2">2</a>]</span>range of his material, as later studies have
shown. Nearly all the versions he cited have the motive of a ransomed
princess, though the majority of the stories now known to be members of
the cycle do not contain it.</p>
<p>Three years after the publication of Simrock&rsquo;s monograph
Benfey treated some features of the theme in a note appended to his
discussion of <i>The Thankful Beasts</i> in the monumental
<i>Pantschatantra</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e402src" href=
"#xd20e402" name="xd20e402src">4</a> Though he named but a few
variants, he found an Armenian tale which he compared with the European
versions, coming to the conclusion not only that the motive proceeded
from the Orient but also that the Armenian version had the original
form of it. That is, he took the ransom and burial of the dead, the
parting of a woman possessed by a serpent, and the saving of the hero
on the bridal night as the essential features. This was a step in
advance.</p>
<p>George Stephens in his edition of <i>Sir Amadas</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e409src" href="#xd20e409" name="xd20e409src">5</a>
held much the same view. He added several important versions, and
scored Simrock for admitting <i lang="de">Der gute Gerhard</i>, saying
that he could not see that it had &ldquo;any direct connection&rdquo;
with <i>The Grateful Dead</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e420src" href=
"#xd20e420" name="xd20e420src">6</a> He was at least partly in the
right, even though his statement was misleading. According to his
Opinion,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e423src" href="#xd20e423" name=
"xd20e423src">7</a> &ldquo;the peculiar feature of the Princess
(Maiden) being freed from <i>demonic</i> influence by <i>celestial</i>
aid, is undoubtedly the original form of the tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a series of notes beginning in the year 1858 K&ouml;hler<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e435src" href="#xd20e435" name="xd20e435src">8</a>
supplied a large number of variants, which have been invaluable for
succeeding study of the theme. Nowhere, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb3" href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>however, did he give an
ordered account of the versions at his command or discuss the relation
of the elements&mdash;a regrettable omission. The contributions of
Liebrecht,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e454src" href="#xd20e454" name=
"xd20e454src">9</a> though less extensive, were of the same sort. In
his article published in 1868 he said that he thought <i>The Grateful
Dead</i> to be of European origin,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e465src"
href="#xd20e465" name="xd20e465src">10</a> but he added nothing to our
knowledge of the essential form of the story. The following decade saw
the publication by Sepp of a rather brief account of the
motive,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e469src" href="#xd20e469" name=
"xd20e469src">11</a> which was chiefly remarkable for its summary of
classical and pre-classical references concerning the duty of burial.
Like Stephens he assumed that the release of a maiden from the
possession of demons was an essential part of the tale. In 1886 Cosquin
brought the discussion one step further by showing<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e474src" href="#xd20e474" name="xd20e474src">12</a> that the
theme is sometimes found in combination with <i>The Golden Bird</i> and
<i>The Water of Life</i>. He did not, however, attempt to define the
original form of the story nor to trace its development.</p>
<p>By all odds the most adequate treatment that <i>The Grateful
Dead</i> has yet received is found in Hippe&rsquo;s monograph, <i lang=
"de">Untersuchungen zu der mittelenglischen Romanze von Sir Amadas</i>,
which appeared in 1888.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e493src" href=
"#xd20e493" name="xd20e493src">13</a> Not only did he gather together
practically all the variants mentioned previous to that time and add
some few new ones, but he studied the theme with such interpretative
insight that anyone going over the same field would be tempted to offer
an apology for what may seem superfluous labour. Such a follower, and
all followers, must gratefully acknowledge their indebtedness to his
labours. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span></p>
<p>Yet one who follows imperfectly the counsels of perfection may
discover certain defects in Hippe&rsquo;s work. He neglects altogether
Cosquin&rsquo;s hint as to the combination of the theme with <i>The
Water of Life</i> and allied tales, thus leaving out of account an
important element, which is intimately connected with the chief motive
in a large number of tales. Indeed, his effort to simplify, commendable
and even necessary as it is, brings him to conclusions that in some
respects, I believe, are not sound. Though he states the essential
points of the primitive story in a form<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e504src" href="#xd20e504" name="xd20e504src">14</a> which can
hardly be bettered and which corresponds almost exactly to the one that
I have been led to accept from independent consideration of the
material,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e513src" href="#xd20e513" name=
"xd20e513src">15</a> he fails to see that he is dealing in almost every
case, not with a simple theme with modified details but with compound
themes. Thus he starts out with the &ldquo;<span lang="de">Sage vom
dankbaren Toten und der Frau mit den Drachen im
Leibe</span>&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e519src" href="#xd20e519"
name="xd20e519src">16</a> and explains all variations from this type
either by the weakening of this feature and that or by the introduction
of a single new motive, the story of <i>The Ransomed Woman</i>. He
would thus make it appear<a class="noteref" id="xd20e526src" href=
"#xd20e526" name="xd20e526src">17</a> that we have a well-ordered
progression from one combined type to various other combined and
simplified types. Such a series is possible without doubt, but it can
hardly be admitted till the interplay of all accessible themes, which
have entered into combination with the chief theme, is investigated.
Hippe passes these things <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href=
"#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>over silently and so gives the subject a
specious air of simplicity to which it has no right.</p>
<p>I should be the last to deny the necessity of treating narrative
themes each for itself, and I have nothing but admiration for the
general conduct of Hippe&rsquo;s investigation; but I wish to show that
his methods, and therefore his results, are at fault in so far as he
does not recognize the nature of the combinations into which <i>The
Grateful Dead</i> enters. Traces of other stories, unless their
presence is obviously artificial, must be carefully considered, since
in dealing with cycles of such fluid stuff as folk-tales it is
certainly wise to give each element due consideration. Certain minor
errors in Hippe&rsquo;s article will be mentioned in due course, though
my constant obligations to it must be emphasized here.</p>
<p>Since the appearance of Hippe&rsquo;s study no one has treated
<i>The Grateful Dead</i> with such scope as to modify his conclusions.
Perhaps the most interesting work in the field has been that of Dr.
Dutz<a class="noteref" id="xd20e541src" href="#xd20e541" name=
"xd20e541src">18</a> on the relation of George Peele&rsquo;s <i>Old
Wives&rsquo; Tale</i> to our theme. He follows Hippe&rsquo;s scheme,
but gives some interesting new variants. Of less importance, but useful
within its limits, is the section devoted to the saga by Dr. Heinrich
Wilhelmi in his <i lang="de">Studien &uuml;ber die Chanson de Lion de
Bourges</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e552src" href="#xd20e552" name=
"xd20e552src">19</a> Though he added no new versions, the author
studied in detail the relationship of some of the mediaeval forms to
one another, basing his results for the most part on careful textual
comparison. His gravest fault was the thoroughly artificial way in
which he mapped out the field as a whole, a method which could lead
only to erroneous conclusions, since he classified according to a
couple of superficial traits. An English study by Mr. F. H. Groome on
<i>Tobit and Jack the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6"
name="pb6">6</a>]</span>Giant-Killer</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e560src" href="#xd20e560" name="xd20e560src">20</a> unhappily was
written without regard to the previous literature of the subject, and
simply rehearses a number of well-known variants.</p>
<p>In this brief review I have touched only on such studies of <i>The
Grateful Dead</i> as have materially enlarged the knowledge of the
subject or have attempted a discussion of the theme in a broad way. In
the following chapter reference will be made to other works, in which
particular versions have been printed or summarized. <span class=

<p>In the apocryphal book of <i>Tobit</i>. According to Neubauer,
<i>The Book of Tobit, a Chaldee Text from a unique MS. in the Bodleian
Library</i>, 1878, p. xv, <i>Tobit</i> was originally written in
Hebrew, although the Hebrew text preserved was taken from Chaldee.
Neubauer (p. xvii) quotes Graetz, <i lang="de">Geschichte der
Juden</i>, (2nd ed.) iv. 466, as saying that the book was written in
the time of Hadrian, and he concludes that it cannot be earlier because
it was unknown to Josephus. The correspondence with <i>Sir Amadas</i>,

<p><i>The Factor&rsquo;s Garland</i> or <i>The Turkey Factor</i>, a
tale in English verse, which may be regarded as a popular ballad,
though by no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=

reprinted as a chapbook or broadside. The library of Harvard University
possesses copies of no less than eight different editions (see W. C.
Lane, <i>Catalogue of English and American Chap-Books and Broadside
Ballads in Harvard College Library</i>, 1905, nos. 809&ndash;815,
2420). An examination of these shows that they differ from each other
in no essential point, though they vary considerably in statements of
time. The British Museum <i>Catalogue of Printed Books</i> lists seven
editions, all different from those at Harvard, with one possible
exception. The popularity of the story, at one time at least, is thus
strikingly illustrated. Another variant, reported from oral tradition,
has been found in North Carolina. See the paper read by J. B. Henneman
before the Modern Language Association of America on Dec 29, 1906.</p>

<h2 class="label">Chapter III.</h2>
<h2 class="main">Tales with the Simple Theme and Miscellaneous
Combinations.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of the tales enumerated in the previous chapter, over
one hundred in number, all but seventeen fall into well-defined
categories as having <i>The Grateful Dead</i> combined with one or more
of three given themes: <i>The Possessed Woman</i>, <i>The Ransomed
Woman</i>, and <i>The Water of Life</i>. Of these seventeen variants,
moreover, only four can be regarded as having the simple motive of
<i>The Grateful Dead</i>; and they are in part doubtful members of the
family.</p>
<p>The first of them is <i>Simonides</i>, thus related by Cicero:
&ldquo;<span lang="la">Unum de Simonide: qui cum ignotum quendam
proiectum mortuum vidisisset eumque humavisset haberetque in animo
navem conscendere, moneri visus est ne id faceret ab eo, quem sepultura
adfecerat; si navigavisset, eum naufragio esse periturum; itaque
Simonidem redisse, perisse ceteros, qui tum
navigavissent.</span>&rdquo; The source of Cicero&rsquo;s story we do
not know, but in all probability it was Greek. Whether it really
belongs to our cycle, being so simple in form and nearly two centuries
earlier in date than any other version yet unearthed, is a matter for
very great doubt. It may have arisen quite independently of other
similar tales in various parts of the world, and have no essential
connection with our tale; but it deserves special consideration, not
only from its antiquity, but also from its subsequent history in lineal
descent through Valerius <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href=
"#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>Maximus, and possibly Robert
Holkot<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2421src" href="#xd20e2421" name=
"xd20e2421src">1</a> to Chaucer. We are at least justified in looking
for some influence of so well-known an anecdote upon
better-authenticated members of the cycle.</p>
<p>The three other variants with the simple theme are all folk-tales of
recent gathering. The first of them is <i>Jewish</i>,<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e2432src" href="#xd20e2432" name="xd20e2432src">2</a> which
runs as follows: The son of a rich merchant of Jerusalem sets off after
his father&rsquo;s death to see the world. At Stamboul he finds hanging
in chains the body of a Jew, which the Sultan has commanded to be left
there until his co-religionists shall have repaid the sum that the man
is suspected of having stolen from his royal master. The hero pays this
sum, and has the corpse buried. Later during a storm at sea he is saved
by a stone on which he is brought to land, whence he is carried by an
eagle back to Jerusalem. There a white-clad man appears to him,
explaining that he is the ghost of the dead, and that he has already
appeared as stone and eagle. The spirit further promises the hero a
reward for his good deed in the present and in the future life.</p>
<p>The second variant is the <i>Annamite</i> tale. Two poor students
were friends. One died and was buried by the other, whose fidelity was
such that he remained three years by the tomb. He dreamed that his
friend came to him and said that he should gain the title of <i lang=
"vi">tra&#803;ng <span class="corr" id="xd20e2442" title=
"Source: nguyen">nguy&ecirc;n</span></i>. So he built a chapel by the
tomb, where the dead friend often appeared to him. When the king heard
of his loyalty, he was praised and rewarded with a title. After his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>death the two friends appeared to their son and
daughter, bidding them marry.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2447src" href=
"#xd20e2447" name="xd20e2447src">3</a></p>
<p>The third story is <i>Servian VI.</i> An uncle of Adam, who honoured
God and the &ldquo;Vile,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2458src"
href="#xd20e2458" name="xd20e2458src">4</a> was so good a man that God
came to him in human form one day. After a battle between the good and
evil in the world, the latter would not bury the slain. The Vile told
Tuegut that this would not do, so he hitched up his wagon and carried
the slain to their graves. Then God came to earth, told him to put all
he possessed in his wagon, and carried him on a cloud to heaven, where
he was made the constellation now called Driver Tuegut&rsquo;s Heavenly
Wagon.</p>
<p>Of these three tales the <i>Annamite</i> does not fulfil the usual
condition that the dead man shall be a stranger to the one who does the
good action. Together with <i>Simonides</i>, all of them vary widely in
the reward given the hero. In <i>Simonides</i> he is warned against
embarkation, and thus saved from shipwreck; in the <i>Jewish</i> he is
actually rescued from a storm-tossed vessel by the ghost, which
masquerades as a rock and an eagle, and afterward promises him further
rewards here and hereafter; in the <i>Annamite</i> he is provided with
earthly glory; and in <i>Servian VI.</i> he becomes a part of the
galaxy of heaven. Only the underlying idea is the same,&mdash;that the
burial of the dead is a pious act and a sacred duty, which will meet a
fitting reward.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2485src" href="#xd20e2485"
name="xd20e2485src">5</a> This belief is so widespread and ancient that
it is not difficult to surmise how stories inculcating the duty might
have grown up independently in many lands. At the same time, the very
diversity of reward in these simple tales allies them to one or another
of the compound types, which, though <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>multiform and widespread,
are yet unmistakably the offspring of a single parent form, or better,
of a chance union between two motives.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2490src" href="#xd20e2490" name="xd20e2490src">6</a> Thus
<i>Simonides</i> and <i>Jewish</i> recall the combination of <i>The
Grateful Dead</i> with <i>The Ransomed Woman</i>, since they have the
hero rescued from drowning by the ghost, and they suggest one point of
union between the two themes. It therefore seems best to include them
in our list, not only for the sake of completeness, but because they
point to the reason which sometime and somewhere gave rise to a more
developed form of the motive,&mdash;to the <i>m&auml;rchen</i> as we
shall study it. A consideration of these basal principles can be
undertaken, however, only after the story theme in its various
ramifications and modifications has been thoroughly discussed.</p>
<p>The probability that <i>The Grateful Dead</i> once existed in a
simple, uncompounded form, which became the parent on one side of the
more important combined types, is strengthened by the minor compounds
in which it is found. How can the correspondences of detail seen in a
considerable number of different compounds, as far as they run
parallel, be otherwise explained? Surely it is more reasonable to
believe in the existence of such a parent form than to suppose that an
originally complicated form was hacked and hewn asunder to produce new
compounds. This will become clearer, I hope, as we proceed.</p>
<p>In <i>Greek</i>, a boy was sold to a pasha, who betrothed him to his
daughter. Because of the mother&rsquo;s objections, however, he was
sent away as a shepherd, while the girl was promised to another
pasha&rsquo;s son. The hero fed his flock under the shelter of the
castle, and was summoned by the maiden, who gave him her betrothal ring
in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>beaker, though pretending not to know him. The
next day she asked her parents to let the two suitors go into the world
with a thousand piasters apiece, and see which came back with the most
money. So they were sent forth. The pasha&rsquo;s son remained in a
city enjoying his money, while the shepherd went on till he met an old
man, to whom he told his story. The man gave him a thousand piasters
more, and told him to buy an ape in a town hard by. He succeeded in
doing this, and brought the ape back to the old man, who cut it in
pieces, much to the youth&rsquo;s disgust, and made eye-salve of the
brain. With this he sent the hero away after exacting a promise of half
of what was obtained. The youth won a thousand piasters by curing the
blind, and later a great sum, besides thirty ships, by healing a very
rich man. With this wealth he returned to the old man, and with him to
the city where the pasha&rsquo;s son had sojourned. The latter agreed
to let the shepherd&rsquo;s seal be burned on his arm in return for the
payment of his debts; but, while the hero and the old man sailed home,
he rode fast by land with the story that his rival was dead. The
shepherd arrived at home just in time for his rival&rsquo;s wedding,
and at the end of it showed the bride her ring. She <span class="corr"
id="xd20e2521" title="Source: recognised">recognized</span> her lover,
called her parents, and, after the hero had told his story and proved
it by the seal on his rival&rsquo;s arm, married him. That night the
old man knocked on the door of their chamber, and demanded that the
bride be divided. According to his promise, the hero prepared to cut
her in twain, when the intruder said that he wished only to test his
fidelity, explaining that he was God, Who had taken him under His
protection because his father had sold him in order to keep the lamp
burning in honour of his saint.</p>
<p>In this variant the elements of <i>The Grateful Dead</i> have been
merged with a story about how a young man of low birth won a princess
by overcoming another suitor in spite of the treachery of the latter.
As I have met with but one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href=
"#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>example of this, from
Lesbos,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2531src" href="#xd20e2531" name=
"xd20e2531src">7</a> I will <span class="corr" id="xd20e2537" title=
"Source: summarise">summarize</span> it briefly. A princess becomes
enamoured of the son of her father&rsquo;s gardener, and refuses to
marry the son of the first minister. So the two suitors are sent out to
a far country with the understanding that the one who returns first
shall have the princess. On the way the gardener&rsquo;s son helps an
old beggar-woman, whom his rival has spurned, and is told by her how to
cure a sick king (by boiling him and sprinkling him with a certain
powder). For this service the youth obtains a ring of bronze, which has
the virtue of giving whatever its possessor desires. By means of this
he gets a wonderful ship, and sails to the city where the
minister&rsquo;s son, through extravagance, has fallen into poverty. He
provides him with a wretched ship, in which to return home, on
condition that he may mark him with his ring. The minister&rsquo;s son
reaches home in his crazy vessel, and is about to marry the princess,
when the hero appears on his beautiful ship of gold, exposes his rival,
and weds the lady. The remainder of the story, which tells how the
magical ring was lost and afterward recovered, does not concern us. It
will be seen that <i>Greek</i> has preserved only the later part of
<i>The Grateful Dead</i> at all clearly, though that combination with a
tale of the type of the Lesbian narrative has actually taken place is
evident from the part which the helper plays. He not only obtains a
promise of division, but calls for its fulfilment. His first appearance
is, however, quite unmotivated, while the old woman of the Lesbian
story serves the purpose, according to a common formula, of showing the
hero&rsquo;s kindness in contrast to his rival&rsquo;s hard heart. The
point common to the two tales, which led to their combination, is
without doubt this helping friend.</p>
<p>In <i>Servian V.</i> a youth on a journey pays his all to rescue a
debtor from hanging. By his new-found friend <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>the
youth is led to the wondrous Vilaberg, where he is left with the
admonition that he must not speak. He disobeys, and is made dumb and
blind by an enchantress; but he is cured by the man whom he rescued,
who plays on a pipe and gives him a healing draught. So he dwells for
some years in the mountain with one of the ladies as his wife, but
afterward goes home, though every summer he returns to his friends in
the Vilaberg.</p>
<p>Here we have our theme combined with a form of <i>The
Swan-Maiden</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2560src" href="#xd20e2560"
name="xd20e2560src">8</a> which occurs in only one other case, as far
as I am able to discover. The reason for the combination is not far to
seek. The latter part of the tale represents the reward of the rescuer
by the rescued. That the benefit does not take the form of actual
burial need not disturb us. The man was at least far gone towards
death, and he was a debtor&mdash;a trait found in about two-thirds of
the variants known to me. Moreover, the supernatural character of the
comrade is indicated by the adventure into which he leads the youth.
The tale has been partly rationalised, that is all.</p>
<p><i>Esthonian I.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd20e2578src" href=
"#xd20e2578" name="xd20e2578src">9</a> shows a different combination,
which is unique as far as I know. In a gorge not far from the village
of Aruk&auml;la (near Wesenberg) a howling was heard every night for
years. Finally a bold man went by night to the place and found the
skeleton of a murdered king, which told him that it had howled thus for
a hundred years because it had not been buried with holy rites. The
next day the man took the bones to a priest, and, while burying them,
discovered an enormous treasure.</p>
<p>As Schiefner said,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2583src" href=
"#xd20e2583" name="xd20e2583src">10</a> when he first printed the
story, it recalls the Grimms&rsquo; <i lang="de">Der singende
Knochen</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2591src" href="#xd20e2591"
name="xd20e2591src">11</a> which in turn is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>a
compound of <i>The Water of Life</i>, with the idea of murder
discovered by means of a dead man&rsquo;s bones. The Esthonian tale
has, however, only the latter circumstance, combined with a simple form
of <i>The Grateful Dead</i>. The hero&rsquo;s reward is
immediate&mdash;he finds gold in the earth while digging the grave; and
the ghost does not appear. The variant is thus of no great
significance.</p>
<p>The group of tales that must next be considered furnishes rather
more important evidence as to the development of the theme. It is a
compound of <i>The Grateful Dead</i> with the motive which we may call
<i>The Spendthrift Knight</i>. As far as I know, the type is purely
mediaeval. The group includes <i>Richars, Lion de Bourges, Dianese, Old
Swedish, Rittertriuwe</i>, and <i>Sir Amadas</i>.</p>
<p>The plot of <i>Richars</i>, as far as it concerns us, runs thus:
Richars, in the pursuit of knightly exercises, wastes all his
father&rsquo;s property as lord of Mangorie. When he hears that the
King of Montorgueil has promised the hand of his daughter to the victor
in a tourney, he is sad at the thought of his inability to engage.
Through the generosity of a provost, however, he is enabled to set out
with a horse, three attendants, and a supply of gold. At the city of
Osteriche he spends part of his money in giving a great feast. In the
roof of the house where he stays he is astonished to see a corpse lying
on two beams, and he learns that it is the body of a knight, who died
owing the householder three thousand pounds. Richars gives everything
he has, even to his armour, to secure the release and burial of the
dead man. He then proceeds to the tourney on a poor horse that his host
gives him, and quite alone, since his attendants have deserted him. On
the way he is joined by a White Knight, who offers him help in the
tourney and places at his disposal his noble steed. Richars wins the
tourney <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>and obtains the hand of the Princess Rose. He now
offers the White Knight his choice of the lady or the property. The
stranger, however, refuses any division, explains that he is the ghost
of the indebted knight, and disappears.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2629src" href="#xd20e2629" name="xd20e2629src">12</a></p>
<p><i>Lion de Bourges</i> runs thus: Lion, son of Duke Harpin de
Bourges, was found by a knight in a lion&rsquo;s den and reared as his
son. When he grew up, he wasted his foster-father&rsquo;s property in
chivalry. Finally, he heard that King Henry of Sicily had promised the
hand of his daughter to the knight who should win a tourney that he had
established. So Lion started for the court, and on the way ransomed the
body of a knight, which he found hanging in the smoke, on account of
unpaid debts. At Montluisant the hero won the favour of the Princess
Florentine, and, before the tourney, obtained from a White Knight the
charger which he still lacked, on condition of sharing his winnings,
the princess excepted. With the help of this knight Lion was victorious
and obtained the princess. He was then asked by his helper to give up
either the lady or the whole kingdom, and did not hesitate to do the
latter. At this, the stranger explained that he was the ghost of the
ransomed knight and disappeared, though he afterwards returned to
assist the hero at need. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href=
"#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span></p>
<p>According to <i>Dianese</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2667src"
href="#xd20e2667" name="xd20e2667src">13</a> the knight of that name
has wasted his substance. When he hears that the King of Chornualglia
(Cornwall) has promised his daughter and half of his kingdom to the
knight who wins the tourney that he has called, Dianese gets his
friends to fit him out and sets forth. On the way he passes through a
town where the traffic is diverted from the main street because of a
corpse which has long been lying on a bier before a church. He learns
that it is the body of a knight, who cannot be buried till his
creditors have been paid. At the cost of everything he possesses, save
his horse, the hero satisfies the creditors and has the knight buried.
When he has gone on two miles, he is joined by a merchant, who promises
him money, horses, and weapons if he will give in return half of what
he wins in the tourney. Dianese agrees, is fitted out anew, and
succeeds in overcoming all comers in the contest. Thus he obtains the
hand of the princess and half the kingdom. With his bride, the
merchant, and his followers he starts for home; but, when they are only
a day&rsquo;s journey from their destination, he is required by the
merchant to fulfil his promise&mdash;to choose between his bride as one
half, his possessions as the other. Dianese takes the lady and rides
on. Soon, however, he is joined by the merchant, who praises his
faithfulness, gives up the treasures, explains that he is the ghost of
the debtor knight, and disappears.</p>
<p>In <i>Old Swedish</i><a class="noteref" id="xd20e2674src" href=
"#xd20e2674" name="xd20e2674src">14</a> the daughter and heiress of the
King of France promises to marry whatever knight is victor in a tourney
which she announces. Pippin, the Duke of Lorraine, hears of this and
sets out for France. At the end of his first day&rsquo;s journey he
finds lodging at the house of a widow, who is lamenting because her
husband, once in good circumstances, has died so poor that she cannot
bury him properly. Pippin takes pity <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>on her, and pays for the
man&rsquo;s funeral. On his further journey he falls in with a man on a
noble steed, who gives him the horse on condition of receiving half of
whatever he shall win. Unthinkingly Pippin agrees and wins the tourney
with the help of the horse. After he has married the princess, he is
asked by the helper to fulfil his promise. He offers at first half,
then the whole of his kingdom, in order to keep his bride, and is
finally told by the man that he is the ghost of the dead, while the
horse was an angel of God.</p>
<p><i>Rittertriuwe</i> is of the same romantic character. When Graf
Willekin von Montabour had spent his substance in chivalrous exercises,
he learned that a beautiful and rich maiden had promised her hand to
the knight, who should win a tourney, which she had established.
Thereupon he set forth and came to the place announced for the combats.
There he found lodging in the house of a man, who would only receive
him if he would promise to pay the debts of a dead man, whose body lay
unburied in the dung of a horse-stall.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2683src" href="#xd20e2683" name="xd20e2683src">15</a> Willekin
was moved by this story and paid seventy marks, almost all his money,
to ransom the corpse and give it suitable burial. He then had to borrow
from his host in order to indulge in his customary generosity. On the
morning of the jousting he obtained from a stranger knight a fine horse
on condition of dividing everything that he won. He succeeded in the
tourney above all the other contestants, and so wedded the maiden. On
the second night after the marriage the stranger entered his room and
demanded a share in his marital rights. After he had offered instead to
give all his possessions, the hero started from the room in tears, when
the stranger called him back and explained that he was the ghost of the
dead, then disappeared. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href=

<p>A brief summary of <i>Sir Amadas</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2695src" href="#xd20e2695" name="xd20e2695src">16</a> the last of
the six variants, must now be given. Amadas finds himself financially
embarrassed, and sets forth for seven years of errantry with only forty
pounds in hand. This he pays to release and bury the body of a merchant
who has died in debt. When thus reduced to absolute penury, Amadas
meets a White Knight, who tells him that he will aid him on condition
of receiving half the gains. The hero finds a rich wreck on the
seacoast, and so with new apparel goes to the court, where he wins
wealth in a tourney and the princess&rsquo;s heart at a feast. After he
marries her and has a son born to him, the White Knight reappears and
demands that the accepted conditions be complied with. Hesitatingly
Amadas prepares to divide first his wife and afterwards his son, but he
is stayed by the stranger, who explains that he is the ghost of the
dead merchant. So Amadas is at last released from misfortune and lives
in happiness.</p>
<p>In all six of these stories we have a knight, who sets out to win a
tourney in which the victor&rsquo;s prize is to be the hand of a
princess. In all of them save <i>Old Swedish</i> he is represented as
being impoverished by previous extravagance, in <i>Richars, Lion de
Bourges</i>, and <i>Rittertriuwe</i> it being expressly stated that he
had wasted his fortune by over-indulgence in his passion for jousting.
On his way to the place appointed for the contest the hero pays for the
burial<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2710src" href="#xd20e2710" name=
"xd20e2710src">17</a> of a man whose corpse is held for debt.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e2719src" href="#xd20e2719" name=
"xd20e2719src">18</a> He goes on and is approached either before
(<i>Richars, Lion de Bourges, Dianese, Old Swedish</i>, and <i>Sir
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>Amadas</i>) or after (<i>Rittertriuwe</i>) he
reaches the lists by a man, who provides him with a horse, by the aid
of which he wins the tourney and the princess. In <i>Dianese</i> the
hero is a merchant, in <i>Old Swedish</i> his estate is not mentioned,
but in the other four variants he appears as a knight (a white knight
in <i>Richars, Lion de Bourges</i>, and <i>Sir Amadas</i>). In
<i>Dianese</i> the hero is also provided with armour; in <i>Richars</i>
and <i>Lion de Bourges</i> he is assisted in his jousting by the White
Knight; and in <i>Sir Amadas</i> he finds a wreck on the coast from
which he obtains all things needful. In <i>Richars</i> we find the
somewhat inept conclusion that the hero asks his friendly helper
whether he will take the princess or the property<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2769src" href="#xd20e2769" name="xd20e2769src">19</a> as his
share. The latter responds that he wishes only his horse, explains who
he is, and vanishes. In all the other variants, however, the condition
is made that the hero divide whatever he shall gain.<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e2775src" href="#xd20e2775" name="xd20e2775src">20</a></p>
<p>With reference to <i>Richars</i> and <i lang="fr">Lion de
Bourges</i>, Wilhelmi&rsquo;s careful discussion<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2789src" href="#xd20e2789" name="xd20e2789src">21</a> has made it
clear that, though they agree in many points as against all the other
related versions, not only in respect to <i>The Grateful Dead</i>, but
to the further course of a complicated narrative, neither one could
have been taken from the other. The difference in the matter of the
division between <i>Richars</i> and all the other variants he neglects,
though it strengthens his position. Back of <i>Richars</i> and <i>Lion
de Bourges</i>, earlier than the thirteenth century, there must have
existed a literary work which was their common source. This
hypothetical French romance may be considered as the foundation of the
whole group which we are discussing.</p>
<p>Since <i>Old Swedish</i> agrees with most of the other variants with
regard to the division, and furthermore <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>with <i>Rittertriuwe</i>,
in stating that the hero offered all his property in order to keep his
wife, there seems to be no doubt that it belongs to this particular
group, despite the fact that it says nothing about the hero&rsquo;s
poverty. The connection is not improbable on the score of chronology,
if we suppose that the source of <i>Richars</i> and <i lang="fr">Lion
de Bourges</i>, or some similar tale, found its way into the North by
translation in the first half of the thirteenth century, a time when
translations into Icelandic at any rate were made in great numbers.
Indeed, the names Pippin, Lorraine, etc., immediately suggest a French
source; and the story is not really a legend at all, though it appears
in a legendary, but a narrative quite in the style of the <i>romans
d&rsquo;adventure</i>.</p>
<p>With reference to <i>Sir Amadas</i>, two points of special interest
appear. The hero is provided the wherewithal for his successful
courtship by means of a wreck to which he is directed by the White
Knight; and he is required to divide his child as well as his wife with
his helper. These peculiarities, together with the different opening,
make it improbable that <i>Richars</i>, as preserved, was the direct
source of the romance, though its author may have known some text
either of that romance, or of <i>Lion de Bourges</i>. It seems more
likely, however, that the source of <i>Sir Amadas</i> was rather the
common original of both those versions. In the present state of the
evidence it is impossible to do more than to show, as I have attempted
to do, that the fourteenth-century <i>Sir Amadas</i> is a member of the
little group under discussion.</p>
<p>The proposed division of the son is peculiarly important in that it
connects the group with the stories in which <i>The Grateful Dead</i>
is compounded with the theme of <i>Amis and Amiloun</i>. Indeed, the
general relationship of <i>The Spendthrift Knight</i> to that theme
must be considered in a later chapter<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2856src" href="#xd20e2856" name="xd20e2856src">22</a> after more
important compounds have been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href=
"#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>discussed. It will be noted that the
group just considered is purely literary and purely mediaeval. Though
it has representatives in Italy, Germany, Sweden, and England, it is to
all intents and purposes French in source and character. Five of its
members are the only variants treated in this chapter where the
question of dividing the hero&rsquo;s prize is brought up. The group
thus stands by itself, and may be considered as an entity when we come
to a discussion of the larger matters of relationship.</p>
<p>A solitary folk-tale now demands attention&mdash;my <i>Breton II.
The Grateful Dead</i> in a simple form is here combined with a story
told of Gregory the Great,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2866src" href=
"#xd20e2866" name="xd20e2866src">23</a> as Luzel, to whom the tale was
recounted by a <i>Breton</i> peasant, indeed briefly noted.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e2908src" href="#xd20e2908" name=
"xd20e2908src">24</a> The Breton tale runs as follows: A rich lord and
lady had no children. While the lady was praying to St. Peter in a
chapel that was being repaired, she fell a victim to a young painter,
and had by him a son, who was named after St. Peter. When the boy was
twelve years of age, he carried St. Peter across a stream one day,
while his shepherd companion <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href=
"#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>carried Christ. The companion died
soon after. Pierre then set forth to visit his patron in Paradise. On
his way he stopped overnight at the house of an old woman, whose
husband lay unburied because there was no money to pay the priest.
Pierre gave all his money for the interment, and went on. When he came
to the sea, a naked man, who said that he was the dead, carried him
across to a point near the gates of Paradise. There he found Peter, and
was shown the glories of heaven by the Saviour, as well as Purgatory
and Hell. In the last he saw a chair reserved for his mother, but by
his entreaties induced the Lord to grant her a release on condition of
doing penance himself for her. So he was told to put on a spiked
girdle, to throw the key of it into the sea, and not to take it off
till the key should be found. After donning this instrument Pierre was
carried by the ghost back to his own land, where he lived on
alms&mdash;first on the public ways, and later, without discovering
himself, in his father&rsquo;s castle. During his father&rsquo;s
absence he was killed at the command of his mother, but was dug up
alive by his father and treated with respect. One day at a feast he
found the key in the head of a fish. When the girdle was opened, he
died, and his soul was borne to heaven by angels.</p>
<p>Two Danish variants present a curious but not inexplicable
combination of <i>The Grateful Dead</i> with <i>Puss in Boots</i>, as
was noted by K&ouml;hler.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2921src" href=
"#xd20e2921" name="xd20e2921src">25</a> <i>Danish I.</i> relates how a
youth pays three marks, which is his all, to bury the body of a dead
man, for whose interment the priest has demanded payment in advance. He
is then joined by another youth, who is the ghost of the dead, and goes
to a certain city. There, by giving himself out as a prince at the
advice of his companion, who provides him with proper trappings, he
wins the hand of a princess. In <i>Danish II.</i> an old soldier pays
his last three marks to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href=
"#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>prevent three creditors from digging
up a corpse. He is joined by a pale stranger, who takes him in a leaden
ship to a land where he marries a princess, who is fated to marry no
one save a man who comes in this way. The stranger secures, by a lying
ruse, a troll&rsquo;s castle for the hero, and, after explaining that
he is the ghost of the buried debtor, disappears.</p>
<p>The traces of the <i>Puss in Boots</i> motive<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2940src" href="#xd20e2940" name="xd20e2940src">26</a> are, I
think, sufficiently clear, especially in the first of the two variants,
since the point of that familiar tale is certainly that the hero
marries a woman of high estate by making himself out as of equal rank,
substantiating his statements by a succession of clever ruses. That the
grateful dead enables him to fulfil the required conditions is an
introduction that could easily replace the ordinary one, especially
since a helper of some sort is necessary to the story. Just what the
relation of these two variants is to other <i>Puss in Boots</i> stories
does not here concern us. From the side of <i>The Grateful Dead</i>,
however, it is possible to see how the combination&mdash;found only in
two folk-tales from a single country, it will be observed&mdash;may
have arisen. The benefits bestowed on the hero show an essential
likeness to those found in a widespread compound type to be studied in
a later chapter,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2964src" href="#xd20e2964"
name="xd20e2964src">27</a> where the thankful dead helps his friend to
obtain a wife by the performance of some feat. Since the combination
now in consideration seems to be confined to the region about Denmark,
while mediaeval and modern examples of the other are found in many
lands, it may be regarded as a mere variation on the better-known
compound type, produced by the similarity of the two endings. Yet
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>it has to be treated separately, because it
involves an independent theme.</p>
<p>An echo of the simple theme of <i>The Grateful Dead</i> is found in
two English plays&mdash;Massinger&rsquo;s <i>Fatal Dowry</i> and
Rowe&rsquo;s <i>Fair Penitent</i>. In the former young <span class=
"corr" id="xd20e2981" title="Source: Charalois">Charolais</span> goes
to prison to release his father&rsquo;s body from the clutch of
creditors, who wish to keep it unburied for vengeance.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e2984src" href="#xd20e2984" name=
"xd20e2984src">28</a> He is rescued by Rochfort, who pays the debts and
gives him his daughter in marriage. The intrigues of love and vengeance
that follow do not concern us. In Rowe&rsquo;s play, which was based on
Massinger&rsquo;s, this part has been curtailed to a few slight
references. Altamont gives himself as ransom for his father&rsquo;s
body to the greedy creditors, who will not allow burial to take place.
He is rewarded by the care and bounty of Sciolto, who becomes a second
father to him.</p>
<p>Stephens was certainly right in connecting<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2989src" href="#xd20e2989" name="xd20e2989src">29</a> the story
in <i>The Fatal Dowry</i> with <i>The Grateful Dead</i>, though it is
only a fragment and lacks some of the most essential features of the
complete theme. The ghost, indeed, does not appear at all, but the part
played by Rochfort may be regarded as a greatly sophisticated
reminiscence of that trait, especially since he not only rescues the
hero, but provides him with a wife. The echo of the theme is too vague
for us to distinguish the form in which it was found by Massinger,
though I think that we should not go far wrong in supposing that he had
in mind some narrative, either popular or literary, nearly approaching
the compound type treated in chapter vi. below. As one of the
comparatively few traces that the motive has left in England this
double dramatic use is not without interest.<a class="noteref" id=

<h2 class="main"><i>The Grateful Dead</i> and <i>The Poison
Maiden</i>.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One of the most prevalent types of <i>The Grateful
Dead</i> is that in which it has combined with <i>The Poison
Maiden</i>, a theme almost world-wide in distribution and application.
From the time of Benfey and Stephens<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e3023src" href="#xd20e3023" name="xd20e3023src">1</a> the
connection between the two themes has been regarded as vital. Though
Hippe <span class="corr" id="xd20e3026" title=
"Source: recognised">recognized</span> that the stories were perhaps
originally independent,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3029src" href=
"#xd20e3029" name="xd20e3029src">2</a> he took the compound as his
point of departure and derived all other forms from it. As will be seen
in the course of our study, such a filiation is exceedingly improbable,
if the essential features of <i>The Grateful Dead</i> and <i>The Poison
Maiden</i> be closely examined. Hippe went wrong, I should say, in
failing to differentiate between what traits belong to the former and
what to the latter theme.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, <i>The Poison Maiden</i> exists in a cycle of
its own. Any doubt about this and any necessity of studying the theme
in detail here is removed by the valuable monograph of Wilhelm Hertz,
<i lang="de">Die Sage vom Giftm&auml;dchen</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e3047src" href="#xd20e3047" name="xd20e3047src">3</a> in which the
literature of the subject has been marshalled with masterly skill.
Starting with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45"
name="pb45">45</a>]</span>stories of how a maiden, who had been fed
with snake-poison, was sent to Alexander the Great from India by an
enemy, and how the plot to kill the emperor through her embraces was
foiled by the cunning of Aristotle,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3057src"
href="#xd20e3057" name="xd20e3057src">4</a> Hertz shows<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e3067src" href="#xd20e3067" name="xd20e3067src">5</a>
that the central idea of the tale is the belief that a man could be
killed by sexual connection with a woman who had been nourished on
poison. In most of the variants, to be sure, it is the bite of the
woman that is venomous, while in others it is her glance or her breath;
but these are natural modifications. Without following the study into
details, the important fact to remember is that there has existed from
early times a tale relating how a man was saved by a watchful friend on
his bridal night from a maiden whose embraces were certain
death.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3070src" href="#xd20e3070" name=
"xd20e3070src">6</a> With this in mind we can safely proceed to a
consideration of the variants of <i>The Grateful Dead</i> which have
similar features.</p>
<p>Twenty-four of the stories in my list fall into this category, viz.:
<i>Tobit, Armenian, Gypsy, Siberian, Russian <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>I., II.,
III.</i>, and <i>IV., Servian II., III.</i>, and <i>IV., Bulgarian,
Esthonian II., Finnish, Rumanian I., Irish I., II.</i>, and <i>III.,
Breton I., Danish III., Norwegian II., Simrock X., Harz I., Jack the
Giant Killer</i>, and <i>Old Wives&rsquo; Tale</i>. All but three of
them<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3102src" href="#xd20e3102" name=
"xd20e3102src">7</a> are folk-tales, a fact that considerably
simplifies the discussion.</p>
<p>According to the apocryphal story, Tobit buries by night the dead
who lie in the street. He is thrown into prison, and later becomes
blind and poverty-stricken. He sends his son Tobias to his brother
Gabael for the return of a loan. The youth is accompanied by the angel
Raphael in disguise, who calls himself Azarias. On the journey Tobias
catches a fish and preserves the heart, liver, and gall at the bidding
of his companion. When they arrive at their journey&rsquo;s end, the
angel, as go-between, asks Gabael&rsquo;s daughter Sara in wedlock for
Tobias, though seven men have died while consummating their marriage
with her. By burning the heart and liver of the fish at the command of
the angel, and by prayer, Tobias escapes; for the demon Asmodeus is
driven out of the maiden and bound by Raphael. With his bride and
companion Tobias goes home, where he cures Tobit&rsquo;s blindness by
means of the gall of the fish. After being offered half of the wealth
that he has brought the family, Raphael explains his identity and
disappears.</p>
<p>This variant is peculiar in that the father does the good action,
while the son is chiefly rewarded. Indeed, it is the son whose life is
saved from the possessed woman whom he marries. Moreover, the grateful
dead is replaced by an angel, who indeed commends Tobit for his good
deed, but is certainly a substitute for the ghost. Obviously
<i>Tobit</i> with such peculiarities as these cannot be regarded as the
general source of the widespread folk-tale. At the same time we must
not forget that it has been, perhaps, the best-loved story in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>Apocrypha,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3119src"
href="#xd20e3119" name="xd20e3119src">8</a> and that its influence on
details of the narrative may be looked for almost anywhere in
Christendom.</p>
<p>In the <i>Armenian</i> story from Transcaucasia<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e3133src" href="#xd20e3133" name="xd20e3133src">9</a> a man
finds a corpse hanging in a tree and being beaten by his late
creditors. The man pays the debt and buries the body. Some years later
he becomes poor. A rich man offers him in marriage his daughter, with
whom five bridegrooms have already met death on the wedding night.
While thinking over the proposition, he is approached by a man who
offers to become his servant for half of his future possessions, and
counsels him to marry the woman. On the night of the marriage the
servant stands with a sword in the chamber, cuts off the head of a
serpent that comes from the bride&rsquo;s mouth, and pulls out its
body. Later he asks for his share of his master&rsquo;s gains. When he
is about to split the woman through the middle, a second snake glides
from her mouth. The servant then says that he is the ghost of the
corpse long ago rescued, and disappears. Here the story appears in a
very normal form, except that the hero is not taking a journey at the
time of his kind deed, and that he waits several years for his reward.
Moreover, the second snake appears to be due to reduplication.</p>
<p>In <i>Gypsy</i> a youth gives his last twelve piasters for the
release of a corpse, which is being maltreated by Jews. The ghost of
the dead man follows him and promises to get him a bride if he will
share her with him. The youth consents and marries a woman whose five
bridegrooms have died on the wedding night. The companion keeps watch
in the chamber and cuts off the head of a dragon that comes from the
bride&rsquo;s mouth. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48"
name="pb48">48</a>]</span>Later he demands his half of the woman, and
takes a sword to cut her asunder, when she screams and disgorges the
dragon&rsquo;s body. The ghost then explains the situation and
disappears.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3149src" href="#xd20e3149" name=
"xd20e3149src">10</a></p>
<p>With the <i>Siberian</i> variant some very important modifications
enter. A soldier buys a picture of the Saviour from a peasant and
maltreats it. A merchant&rsquo;s son then buys it out of reverence and
takes it to his mother. Later he helps an old man on a raft and goes
with him to market. There he meets the daughter of a priest and, by the
advice of his friend, marries her. When the old man strikes her with a
whip, she splits open, and the devil comes out. She is put together
again by the mysterious companion, and accompanies them home, where the
old man asks for a division of the gains they have made together. Again
he divides the woman. After she has been burned, she is found living
and purified. Then the old man says that he is God and departs.</p>
<p>This tale, found among the Turkish race of southern Siberia, has
transformed the opening incident altogether. For the burial of the
corpse it substitutes a good deed, which is entirely different from the
original trait. Yet it is evident that we have to do with <i>The
Grateful Dead</i>, after all, since the divine image is rescued from
senseless contumely and God himself appears in the r&ocirc;le of the
thankful ghost. It is evident also that the theme is combined with
<i>The Poison Maiden</i>. Though we do not hear of any misadventures of
other men with the priest&rsquo;s daughter, the marvels which attend
her purification indicate the danger in which the hero stood.</p>
<p><i>Russian I.</i> is likewise peculiar in several respects. The
younger of two brothers angers his parents by going <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>to the
wars without their permission. He is killed. Later he appears to his
brother, asking him to implore pardon of their mother, whose anger
prevents him from resting quietly in his grave. The elder brother thus
succeeds in giving peace to the ghost. Later, when he marries a
merchant&rsquo;s daughter, whose first two husbands have been killed by
a dragon on the wedding night, he is saved by the ghost of the dead,
which keeps watch in the chamber with a sword and kills the nine-headed
dragon.</p>
<p>This tale stands almost alone<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3174src"
href="#xd20e3174" name="xd20e3174src">11</a> in giving the two chief
characters personal relations, since it is nearly always a total
stranger whom the hero benefits. That actual burial of the dead does
not come in question is not so remarkable, as various changes have been
made in this trait. One story,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3185src"
href="#xd20e3185" name="xd20e3185src">12</a> indeed, which otherwise
has no likeness, similarly makes the dead man uneasy in his grave. The
beginning of <i>Russian I.</i> has thus suffered considerable
modification. The ending is also different from the normal type in that
the division of the property and the woman has entirely
disappeared.</p>
<p><i>Russian II.</i> has also some peculiarities, though none which is
difficult to explain. A youth named Hans receives three hundred rubles
from his uncle, who has taken his inheritance, and goes into the world.
In another province he ransoms with his whole stock of money an
unbeliever, who is being bled by the people. He has the poor man
baptised, but is not able to save his life, so sorely has he been
wounded. The people, however, pay for proper burial. Hans goes on and
is joined by an angel, who proposes that he take him as uncle and
divide with him whatever they get while in one another&rsquo;s company.
They come to a city where <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href=
"#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>the king proposes that Hans marry his
daughter, and to this the hero agrees at his companion&rsquo;s advice,
despite the protests of the citizens, who say that the princess has
already strangled six bridegrooms. On the wedding night the uncle keeps
watch, and slays a dragon which is approaching to kill the young man.
After two months the pair set out for home with the uncle. On the way
they are saved by the old man from robbers, and get a store of gold.
When they arrive at the place where the uncle first appeared, he calls
for a fulfilment of their agreement, and saws the bride asunder. Young
dragons come out of her; but, when she has been washed and sprinkled
with water, she is made whole. The angel thereupon parts with the
couple.</p>
<p>For the burial of the dead we have in this tale the interesting
substitution of an unsuccessful attempt of the hero to save a
man&rsquo;s life by paying his entire inheritance as ransom. That the
man dies and is buried shows how the change probably arose<span class=
"corr" id="xd20e3200" title="Source: ,">.</span> Strangely enough, as
in the case of <i>Tobit</i>, an angel appears in the r&ocirc;le of the
grateful dead, and, even more oddly, takes the form of the hero&rsquo;s
uncle, who gave him the money with which he set forth on his journey.
The recurrence of the angel in this and in one other variant<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e3206src" href="#xd20e3206" name=
"xd20e3206src">13</a> inclines me to the belief that the essential
feature of the reward in the original story was that it came from
heaven. The remainder of <i>Russian II.</i> has no characteristic
unusual in the tales where the woman is actually divided to get rid of
the snakes or dragons.</p>
<p>In <i>Russian III.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd20e3217src" href=
"#xd20e3217" name="xd20e3217src">14</a> the youngest of three brothers
rescues a swimming coffin from the sea and takes it on his ship. From
the coffin comes a man clothed in a white shirt, who enters the service
of his rescuer, and helps him win a beautiful princess as wife. A
six-headed dragon has hitherto killed all her bridegrooms on the
wedding night, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>but it is overcome by the hero through his
obedience to the advice of his servant. The latter cleanses the
bride&rsquo;s body of the dragon brood and goes away. Here the opening
has been modified, though not beyond recognition, since the rescued man
is clearly enough the grateful dead.</p>
<p><i>Russian IV.</i>, taken like the preceding from a folk-book,
differs from that in only minor points, though the ampler form in which
I have found it makes it of more importance. The three sons of a czar
go out in separate ships to see the world. The youngest, named Sila,
rescues a swimming coffin, which his brothers have not heeded, and
buries it on shore. There he leaves his companions, and goes on alone
till joined by a man dressed in a shroud, who says that he is the
rescued corpse and proposes that Sila win a certain Princess Truda as
wife by his aid. The hero is dismayed when he sees the walls of her
city decorated with the heads of countless former suitors, but he is
told by his servant not to fear. On the bridal night he is counselled
to keep silence, and, when his wife presses her hand on his breast, to
beat her, as she is in league with a six-headed dragon. Sila obeys, the
dragon appears, and the servant cuts off two of its heads. Two more
heads are cut off on the second night, and the remaining two on the
third. The bride is not completely cleansed, however, till the end of a
year, when the servant cuts her in two, burns the evil things that
emerge from her body, and sprinkles her with living water to make her
well again. He then disappears.</p>
<p>Here the grateful dead appears with perfect clearness, as he did not
in <i>Russian III.</i> The course of events by which the lady is won
does not differ materially from that of <i>Russian II.</i> Presumably
<i>III.</i> would follow the same procedure, had we an adequate
summary. <i>III.</i> and <i>IV.</i> are like <i>I.</i>, and different
from <i>II.</i>, in omitting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href=
"#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>all mention of any division of
property or of the woman between hero and assistant. The division for
the sake of cleansing in <i>IV.</i> is, however, actual.</p>
<p>Not without contamination from another source, <i>Russian V.</i> and
<i>VI.</i> still belong to the class containing variants with <i>The
Poison Maiden</i>. In <i>Russian V.</i> the only son of a rich man went
out into the world to seek his fortune. On the road he gave a large sum
of money for two horses. Later he stopped at an inn, where the widow of
the landlord was weeping because she had no money to pay the debts of
her husband, who was cursed by all the people, though he had been dead
two years. The hero gave all his money to save the memory of the dead
man, and proceeded. Soon he met two unsatisfied creditors, who still
cursed the dead landlord, and to them he gave his two horses. Not long
afterward he was joined by a man, who accompanied him on condition of
receiving half of what they might win together. They came to a place
where a lord offered a thousand rubles to anyone who would watch his
daughter&rsquo;s corpse over night in a chapel. The hero undertook the
adventure, and received payment in advance. At dark his companion came
to him, and gave him a cross as protection. At midnight the lady came
out of her coffin, but could not find the man because he held the
cross. The same adventure was repeated the next night. On the third
night the hero, according to his companion&rsquo;s advice, got into the
coffin when the vampire rose, and would not get out for all her
entreaties, being protected by the cross. So in the morning both were
found alive, and were betrothed. Then came the companion, cut the
maiden into halves, took out her entrails, and put her together again,
when she became very beautiful. Next day he called the hero aside,
explained his identity with the dead landlord, and disappeared.</p>
<p><i>Russian VI.</i> differs from the above in several points,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>but is closely allied to it. There were two
brothers, one good and the other stingy. The former expended in
benevolence all his wealth, save a hundred rubles, while the latter
grew richer and richer. A poor man borrowed a hundred rubles from the
miser, calling St. George as witness that he would pay; but he died in
debt. The rich brother came to the widow, and said that he would get
his money from St. George if not from the dead man. He pulled down an
image of the saint from the wall, dug up the corpse, and spat upon them
both. At this juncture the good brother came by, and gave his last
hundred rubles to put the matter right. He then went to a large city,
where the king&rsquo;s daughter had eaten all the deacons who watched
with her dead body. So when volunteers were called for to stay with
her, the hero offered to undertake the task at the advice of an old
man, who promised to pray for his safety on condition of receiving half
his winnings. He received payment in advance from the king, and divided
with the old man, by whom he was given a sanctified coal, a taper, a
cross, and a scapulary, together with advice how to act. So he entered
the chapel, lighted his taper, closed his eyes, made the sign of the
cross, and enclosed himself in a circle marked with the coal near the
head of the bier. At cockcrow the vampire came out all blue and
grinning; but, though she yelled horribly, she could not touch the man
in the circle, who put the cross in the coffin. At the second cockcrow
she tried to get into the coffin, and unavailingly begged him to take
out the cross. At the third cockcrow he put the scapulary on her,
whereupon she rose and thanked him, promising to be his wife and
servant. So in the morning the hero married her and received the
kingdom from her father. To their chamber that night came the old man,
and recalled the agreement to divide. He cut the lady into halves,
minced her flesh on the table, and blew on the bits, whereupon she came
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>together more beautiful than ever. The helper then
threw off his gaberdine, and showed himself to be St. George.</p>
<p>In the two stories just summarized <i>The Grateful Dead</i> is clear
enough, though in <i>VI.</i> St. George has ousted the ghost from part
of its proper functions, just as the angel does in <i>Tobit, Russian
II.</i>, and <i>Simrock IV.</i>, God in <i>Siberian</i>, and various
saints elsewhere. The introduction in <i>VI.</i> is a unique trait, as
far as I know. In both the variants the main features of the theme
appear without distortion, including the picturesque cleansing of the
woman by actual division. <i>The Poison Maiden</i>, however, has been
replaced by a story of similar character, but of different content,
which I have not elsewhere found compounded with <i>The Grateful
Dead</i>. A vampire infests a church (or a churchyard). A soldier is
sent to watch nights, and to try to dislodge her. He successfully
counters her tricks, and finally gets hold of something belonging to
her, which he refuses to return. Thereupon she is reduced to
submission, promises him happiness, and is married to him with the
consent of the king.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3304src" href=
"#xd20e3304" name="xd20e3304src">15</a> This tale, it will be evident,
bears a strong likeness to <i>The Poison Maiden</i> in the figure of
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>heroine, though it certainly is independent. The
vital difference between the two is the absence of any helping friend
in the story of the vampire. Because of the lack of this figure it
seems improbable that the tale was compounded with <i>The Grateful
Dead</i> without the intermediary stage in which <i>The Poison
Maiden</i> appears. I regard the vampire as usurping the place of the
possessed maiden, and the two Russian variants as a secondary growth.
Given the normal form of the compound as it appears in <i>Russian
II.</i>, for instance, there would be no difficulty in substituting an
even more gruesome figure for that of the heroine there depicted, and
in making the hero&rsquo;s danger lie in a prenuptial attack on her
part.</p>
<p>The three Servian tales, which fall in this section, differ widely
in their characteristics. The first of them, <i>Servian
II.</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3372src" href="#xd20e3372" name=
"xd20e3372src">16</a> is the most nearly normal. Vlatko goes into the
world to trade, but pays all his money to free from debt a corpse,
which creditors are digging up in order to vent their spite upon it. He
returns home, and is sent out again by his parents, receiving a greater
sum of money and, from his mother, an apple by means of which he can
tell the intentions of anyone who desires his friendship by the

"xd20e3375src">17</a> He is joined by a man, who cuts the apple into
two exact halves, and so is accepted as a friend. After Vlatko has
prospered in trade, the friend proposes that he marry the
emperor&rsquo;s daughter, with whom ninety-nine men have already died
on the wedding night. Arrangements are made, and the friend keeps watch
in the bridal chamber. During the night he cuts off the heads of three
snakes, which come from the lady&rsquo;s mouth. Sometime afterwards all
three set out for Vlatko&rsquo;s home; and on the way the hero divides
his property with his friend. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href=

they divide the wife, and, after blindfolding the husband, shakes her

disappears.</p>
<p>Like <i>Armenian</i> and <i>Gypsy</i>, this variant has the ghost
cut off the head of the monster (here three snakes) that possesses the
maiden. The actual division of the woman as it appears in those tales
occurs here as a mere jest, which is the case with most of the European
versions.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3395src" href="#xd20e3395" name=
"xd20e3395src">18</a></p>
<p><i>Servian III.</i> has a more romantic character. The daughter of
an emperor had been married thirteen times, but each of her bridegrooms
had died on the wedding night. A certain prince, who had fallen in love
with her through a dream, set out for her castle. On the way he paid
the debts of a poor man, whose corpse was held by creditors, and buried
him. Soon after, he was met by a man who became his servant, and won a
castle for him by a wonderful adventure. After the wedding this man
killed the snakes that came out of the bride, and also caused her to
disgorge three snake eggs by threatening her with his drawn sword. He
then disappeared.</p>
<p>This variant shows traces of foreign substance in the dream and the
winning of the castle by the unrevealed companion. Possibly the latter
trait unites it with the combined type of which <i>The Water of
Life</i> is one of the elements. It will be noticed that the division
of the property and of the woman is not brought into question, though
the sword is used somewhat incongruously for the removal of the last
traces of the heroine&rsquo;s snaky infestation. Thus, by an evident
change in structure, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57"
name="pb57">57</a>]</span>the identity of the hero&rsquo;s companion is
never explained.</p>
<p>With <i>Servian IV.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd20e3422src" href=
"#xd20e3422" name="xd20e3422src">19</a> we encounter a most serious
problem, which must receive special treatment later on,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e3425src" href="#xd20e3425" name=
"xd20e3425src">20</a>&mdash;the relation of <i>The Grateful Dead</i> to
<i>The Thankful Beasts</i> theme. A poor youth three times set free a
gold-fish which he had three times caught. Later he was cast out of his
father&rsquo;s house and sent into the world. He was joined by a man,
who swore friendship with him on a sword, and accompanied him to a city
where many men had been mysteriously slain while undertaking to pass a
night with the king&rsquo;s daughter. The hero undertook the adventure,
and was saved by his companion, who cut off the head of a serpent that
came from the princess&rsquo;s mouth. In the morning the youth was
married to the lady, and divided all his property with his helper. On
their way home the latter demanded half of the bride, and, while she
was held by two servants, swung a sword above her. With a shriek she
cast first two sections, and finally the tail, of a serpent from her
mouth. Thereupon the friend leaped into the sea, for he was the
gold-fish.</p>
<p>The burial of the dead has here been ousted by a good deed which the
hero does to a gold-fish. That the trait is foreign to the type,
however, seems clear. From the time when the companion appears to the
hero, the story follows the normal course until the very end, when the
man unexpectedly leaps into the sea. The thankful dead has been
replaced by the thankful beast, but the tale really belongs to the
present category, since otherwise it has all the characteristics of the
type. Thus the division of the woman is almost precisely similar to
that of <i>Armenian</i> and <i>Gypsy</i>&mdash;that is, the sword is
raised, and the woman disgorges the serpent with a scream. That it
comes out piecemeal may be a faulty recollection <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>of the
actual division. As so often, it is not stated that the companion made
a share of the gains a condition of his help.</p>
<p><i>Bulgarian</i> is in some respects very primitive, though
fragmentary. A father sends his son out into the world to gain
experience. The youth is joined by an archangel, who promises him
assistance on condition that he will pay their joint expenses and will
be obedient. The companion kills a negro and a serpent, and goes with
the hero into their den, where the adventurers find, but leave, great
treasure. They come to a city where the king&rsquo;s daughter has been
thrice married, each time only to have her bridegroom die on the
wedding night. Now she is to be given to any man who can live with her
one night; and many wooers have died in the attempt. The youth offers
himself as a suitor, and is saved by the archangel, who draws a serpent
out of the woman. Later he helps the hero to get the wealth previously
found in the cave, and demands the division of everything, even the
wife. When he cuts her in two, many little snakes fall out of her body.
He then unites her, and gives the hero all the riches they have
obtained.</p>
<p>The burial of the dead has entirely disappeared, as will be
observed, though the other traits of the story show that we must regard
it as of the type now under consideration. The appearance of the
archangel as companion, and the plunder which they take by the way,
suggest the influence of <i>Tobit</i>, which indeed appears as a
folk-tale in the same collection.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3453src"
href="#xd20e3453" name="xd20e3453src">21</a> The conditions made by the
angel are only slightly altered from the normal form, while every other
feature is found intact, even to the actual division of the woman.</p>
<p><i>Esthonian II.</i> has altogether lost the essential features of
our theme; and it has besides put in several traits from a
<i>m&auml;rchen</i>, which, as we shall soon see, is joined
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>to ours with considerable frequency. The inclusion
of this variant here is justified only by some vague traces indicating
that the extraneous parts of the narrative have replaced others which,
if preserved, would make it an ordinary representative of <i>The
Grateful Dead</i>.</p>
<p>A certain couple had a weak-minded son, who could not learn. Wishing
to get rid of him, the father took the boy into a forest and gave him
gladly to an old man whom he chanced to meet. From the man the youth
received books in foreign tongues, which he learned to read in a day.
He then wandered till he came to a city, where lived a princess who was
in the power of devils and went to church with them every night. The
hero watched in the church for three nights, with three, six, and
twelve candles, successively. Thus on the third night he freed the
princess and married her, receiving half the kingdom. He then sought
the old man, who told him to cut the woman in halves and divide her.
The old man halved her himself, when there sprang out a serpent, a
toad, and a lizard. After this he gave her back to her husband.</p>
<p>The obscurity of motivation in this tale makes apparent the
extensive revision that it has undergone. The introduction is nowhere
else found combined, as far as I know, with the stories of our cycle.
The characteristics of <i>The Poison Maiden</i> are sufficiently
evident in the conclusion; but there seems to be no way to account for
the peculiar form of demonic possession, together with the actual
division of the woman, except by supposing, with Dutz,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e3475src" href="#xd20e3475" name=
"xd20e3475src">22</a> that the variant has lost the part concerning the
burial of the dead man. If this be true, the story belongs in the
category where it is here placed.</p>
<p>The <i>Finnish</i> variant<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3483src" href=
"#xd20e3483" name="xd20e3483src">23</a> presents difficulties of a
somewhat different sort. A merchant&rsquo;s son, to whom it has been
foretold that he will marry a three-horned maiden, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>goes
abroad to escape this fate. There he sees the corpse of a debtor
hanging nailed to a church wall, and insulted by the passers-by. He
expends all but nine silver kopecks in rescuing the body, and turns
homeward. He is joined by a companion, who makes the money last three
days, and on the fourth arranges for him to marry the three-horned
daughter of a king. On the wedding night the helper brings the hero
fresh-cut twigs. By beating the maiden with these her blood is
purified, the horns drop off, and she becomes very beautiful.</p>
<p>No new material is here introduced; but the handling is considerably
changed, and the narrative abridged. The woman in the case is
three-horned instead of possessed by snakes, nor is there any hint of
harm to the bridegroom. A reminiscence of the division of the woman,
though not of the dowry, appears in the beating which the ghostly
companion gives her, whereby she is freed from her horns and made very
beautiful. The variant appears to be weakened by frequent
retelling.</p>
<p><i>Rumanian I.</i> is more striking, since it has undergone both
revision and addition. The only daughter of an emperor wears out twelve
pairs of slippers every night, until her father offers her hand and the
heirship of the kingdom to any man who can explain this extraordinary
and costly habit. Many men of high birth and low make the attempt
unsuccessfully. Meanwhile, a certain peasant, whose servant had died
when his year of service was but half ended, had placed the body in a
chest under the roof in revenge for his disappointment. The new servant
had discovered this, and had given the corpse the rites due the dead,
as far as permitted by his master. When he departs at the end of his
year of service, the dead man comes from the earth, thanks him, and
proposes that they swear on the cross to be brothers. So they do, and
go on together till they come to an iron wood. The vampire breaks off a
twig, and casts it to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61"
name="pb61">61</a>]</span>the earth in the place where the
emperor&rsquo;s daughter comes at night with the sons of the dragon.
When she appears, she sees the broken twig, and is afraid. So she goes
to the copper wood, where she sees another twig broken by the vampire,
and hastens on to the place where the sons of the dragon dwell. It is
in going so far that she wears out her slippers. When she comes to the
place, and is about to sit down at table, she drops her handkerchief.
The vampire, who has followed her from the copper wood in the form of a
cat, takes it away, as he does also the spoon that falls from her hand
and the ring that falls from her finger. He goes back to the copper
wood with them, and explains everything to his friend. The latter takes
them to the emperor and wins the lady.</p>
<p>This curious tale has several elements which make it difficult to
classify. As far as the kindness to the dead goes, the matter is
simple. Instead of an agreement between the companions to divide their
gains, however, an oath of brotherhood is introduced. This is probably
a local substitution, since it has long been a custom of the Slavs of
the south to swear brotherhood on the cross,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e3499src" href="#xd20e3499" name="xd20e3499src">24</a> but it
necessitates the further loss of important features at the end of the
narrative such as the saving of the bridegroom on the wedding night and
the division of the maiden (or some modification of that feature) by
the vampire. Indeed, the heroine is rather enchanted than possessed.
The whole series of acts by which she is freed introduces traits into
the narrative which we have hitherto met only in <i>Esthonian II.</i>
Were it not that they are repeated in all the other members of the
group save <i>Breton I.</i>, which we have still to consider, there
would be considerable doubt about placing <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>this variant under the
category of <i>The Grateful Dead</i> + <i>The Poison Maiden</i>. As it
is, we can with security say that this and the following versions
belong here. They have simply modified the normal form by the addition
of certain elements from another theme.</p>
<p>The three Irish versions all have this form. In <i>Irish I.</i> a
king&rsquo;s son, while hunting, pays five pounds to the creditors of a
dead man, so that he may be buried. Later the prince kills a raven, and
declares that he will marry only that woman who has hair as black as
the raven, skin as white as snow, and cheeks as red as blood upon the
snow.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3528src" href="#xd20e3528" name=
"xd20e3528src">25</a> On his way to find her he meets a red-haired
youth, who takes service with him for half of what they may gain in a
year and a day. The youth obtains for him from various giants by
threats of what his master will do<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3534src"
href="#xd20e3534" name="xd20e3534src">26</a> horses of gold and silver,
a sword of light, a cloak of darkness, and the slippery shoes. When
they come to the castle of the maiden, he helps the Prince to keep over
night a comb and a pair of scissors in spite of enchantment, and he
obtains at her bidding the lips of the giant enchanter, which are the
last that she has kissed. He then tells the prince and the
maiden&rsquo;s father to strike her three times, when three devils come
from her mouth in fire. So the prince marries her, and is ready at the
end of a year and a day to divide his child<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e3543src" href="#xd20e3543" name="xd20e3543src">27</a> at the
servant&rsquo;s command. But the latter explains that he is the soul of
the dead man, and disappears.</p>
<p><i>Irish II.</i> differs little except in details from the above.
The king of Ireland&rsquo;s son sets forth to find a woman with hair as
black as the raven, skin as white as snow, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>and
cheeks as red as blood. Ten pounds of the twenty which he takes with
him he pays to release the corpse of a man on which writs are laid. He
meets a short green man, who goes with him for his wife&rsquo;s first
kiss; and he comes upon a gunner, a man listening to the growing grass,
a swift runner, a man blowing a windmill with one nostril, and a strong
man, all of whom accompany him for the promise of a house and garden
apiece. After various adventures in the castles of giants, they arrive
in the east, where the prince&rsquo;s lady dwells. She says that her
suitor must loose her <i>geasa</i> from her before she can marry him.
With the help of the short green man he gives her the scissors, the
comb, and the King of Porson&rsquo;s head, which she requires. He is
then told to get three bottles of healing water from the well of the
western world. The runner sets out for them, and is stopped and put to
sleep by an old hag on the way back; but the earman hears him snoring,
the gunman sees him and wakes him up, and the windman keeps the hag
back till he returns. Finally the strong man crushes three miles of
steel needles so that the prince can walk over them. Thus the bride is
won. The short green man claims the first kiss, and finds her full of
serpents, which he picks out of her. He then tells the youth that he is
the man who was in the coffin, and disappears with his fellows.</p>
<p>In <i>Irish III.</i> three brothers set out from home with three
pounds apiece. The youngest gives his all to pay a dead man&rsquo;s
debts to three giants. He shares his food with a poor man, who offers
to be his servant, saying that the corpse was his brother, and had
appeared to him in a dream.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3560src" href=
"#xd20e3560" name="xd20e3560src">28</a> Jack the servant frightens the
first giant into giving up his sword of sharpness, the second giant his
cloak of darkness, and the third giant his shoes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>of
swiftness. The two Jacks come to the castle of a king, whose daughter
has to be wooed by accomplishing three tasks. Jack the servant follows
the princess in the cloak of darkness to the demon king of
Mor&oacute;co and rescues her scissors. Next day Jack the master runs a
race with the king and beats him because shod with the shoes of
swiftness. That night Jack the servant goes again to the demon king and
cuts off his head with the sword of sharpness, thus accomplishing the
third task. So Jack the master marries the princess.</p>
<p>These three variants make evident the nature of the foreign material
in <i>Esthonian II.</i> and <i>Rumanian I.</i> The whole sub-group,
indeed, has in combination with <i>The Grateful Dead</i> + <i>The
Poison Maiden</i> important elements from the themes of <i>The Water of
Life</i> and <i>The Lady and the Monster</i>. These features will be
considered in detail in a later chapter,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e3586src" href="#xd20e3586" name="xd20e3586src">29</a> when we
study the general type <i>The Grateful Dead</i> + <i>The Water of
Life</i>. For the present it is enough to indicate how the addition has
affected the type with which we are immediately concerned.</p>
<p>Of the three Irish tales, the first two have best preserved the
characteristics of the compound as found in Asia and Eastern Europe.
<i>Irish I.</i> has all the essential features of <i>Armenian</i> and
<i>Gypsy</i>,&mdash;for example, the burial, the agreement to divide
what is gained, and the removal of the evil things by which the woman
is possessed. To be sure, the latter are devils, not serpents, and the
woman is beaten, not divided. Yet the division appears in another form,
since the hero is ready to share his child with the red-haired man, a
trait connected with the theme of <i>Amis and Amiloun</i>.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e3609src" href="#xd20e3609" name=
"xd20e3609src">30</a> <i>Irish II.</i> is in some respects more
changed, and in some respects less, than <i>Irish I.</i> The agreement
to divide is changed to a promise that the green man shall have the
first kiss of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>the bride. On the other hand, the serpents in the
woman&rsquo;s body are retained, a trait which is very primitive and
very important in enabling us to identify the position of these
variants. <i>Irish III.</i> has lost most of the typical features of
the compound. Kennedy&rsquo;s evidence shows that Jack the servant is
to be regarded as really the thankful dead; but the agreement to divide
the gains and the removal of the demons or serpents have entirely
disappeared under pressure from the secondary theme, the essential idea
of which is the accomplishment by the hero of certain unspelling tasks.
In conjunction with the other two variants, however, the position of
<i>Irish III.</i> is clear.</p>
<p>Very different from the Irish tales is <i>Breton I.</i>, since under
the influence of a tendency very common in Brittany, the narrative has
become a Mary legend and has lost its clearness of outline in the
process. Yet it really belongs to this group, replacing by a
dragon-fight and a rescue of the hero from the villain the cleansing of
the bride. At least, I am led to the belief that such is the case by
the fact that the story fits into no other category. Nor is it
surprising that the position of the tale should be obscure in view of
the grotesque transformation which it has undergone.</p>
<p>A youth named Mao pays all his money to have the body of a beggar
interred. The spirit of the dead man helps him win the daughter of a
rich man after killing a dragon in the stables. The lady&rsquo;s
treacherous cousin tries to burn him alive in an old mill, whence he is
saved by the ghost. He forgives the man, and is tricked into promising
him half of all his possessions in order to save his wife. When a son
is born, the villain demands its division. At the hero&rsquo;s appeal,
the Virgin comes with the ghost and takes Mao and his family to heaven,
while the cousin is sent to hell. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66"
href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Norwegian II.</i> and <i>Danish III.</i> stand together, since
the relation of the latter (Andersen&rsquo;s <i lang=
"da">Reisekammeraten</i>) to the former is simply that of a literary
redaction to its original. A brief analysis of each is, however,
necessary.</p>
<p>In <i>Norwegian II.</i> a young peasant on account of a dream sets
forth to win the hand of a princess. On his way he gives most of his
money to bury a dishonest tapster, who has been executed and left
frozen in a block of ice outside a church for passers-by to spit upon.
As he proceeds, the youth is joined by the ghost of the tapster, who
accompanies him. They go to a hill, where they get a magic sword from
one witch, a golden ball of yarn from another, and a magical hat from a
third. Of the yarn they make a bridge, and so come to the
princess&rsquo;s castle. The hero is told to keep her scissors
overnight and loses them; but the companion rides behind the princess
on her goat in the hat of invisibility, when she goes to her troll
lover, and so rescues them. The hero is told to keep a golden ball
overnight, and the same adventure is repeated. The hero is then told to
bring what the princess is thinking of. The companion rides again with
the princess and beats her with his sword, gets the troll&rsquo;s head
for his master, and so enables him to win the lady. On the wedding
night the hero flogs his wife at the advice of the companion, only just
in time to save himself, indeed, as she is about to kill him with a
butcher-knife. He dips her into a tub of whey, whence she comes out
black as a raven, but after a rubbing with buttermilk and new milk she
becomes very beautiful. The companion discovers his identity and
disappears.</p>
<p>In <i>Danish III.</i> poor John, whose father has died, dreams of a
beautiful princess, and sets forth to find her. He does various kind
deeds by the way, and one night takes refuge from the storm in a
church. There <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>he sees two evil men dragging a corpse from its
coffin, and pays his all that it may be buried. He is joined by the
ghost of the dead man, who accompanies him. They get three rods from an
old woman, who is healed by the comrade&rsquo;s salve, and they come to
a city, where they get a sword from a showman, whose puppets are made
alive by the salve. They come to a mountain, where the companion cuts
off the wings of a great white swan and carries them along. They come
at length to the city of the beautiful princess, who is a witch. Anyone
can marry her who guesses three things, but every man who has tried has
failed and been killed. John tells the king that he will try to win
her, and is told to come the next day. In the night the comrade puts on
the wings of the swan, takes the largest of the rods, and follows the
princess when she flies out to the palace of her wizard lover. There he
hears that she is to think of her shoe when her suitor comes in the
morning. All the way to the mountain and back the comrade beats her so
that the blood flows. The next morning he tells John to guess her shoe
when asked what she has thought of. Everyone save the princess rejoices
when the youth guesses right. The next night the companion beats the
princess with two rods as she flies, and learns that she is to think of
her glove. Again everyone is pleased with John&rsquo;s answer. The
third night the companion takes all three rods and the sword. He cuts
off the wizard&rsquo;s head when he learns that the princess is to
think of that, and he gives it to John, wrapped in a handkerchief. John
produces this when asked by the <span class="corr" id="xd20e3658"
title="Source: Princess">princess</span> what she has thought about,
and so he wins her. That night, at the bidding of the companion, he
dips her three times in a tub of water, into which have been shaken
three swan&rsquo;s feathers and some drops from a flask. The first time
she becomes a black swan, the second a white swan, and the third a more
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>beautiful princess than ever. The next day the
comrade explains his identity and disappears.</p>
<p>It will be seen that Andersen simply embroidered the Norwegian tale
as was his wont, adding a good many picturesque details, and softening
some features. The changes do not materially affect the course of the
narrative, nor need they delay us here, interesting though they are of
themselves,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3665src" href="#xd20e3665" name=
"xd20e3665src">31</a> since the position of the variant with reference
to the story-type under consideration is perfectly clear. <i>Norwegian
II.</i> demands further attention. Like <i>Esthonian II., Rumanian
I.</i>, and <i>Irish I., II.</i>, and <i>III.</i>, it has the form
<i>The Grateful Dead</i> + <i>The Poison Maiden</i> + <i>The Water of
Life</i>. The burial of the dead is undisturbed, but the agreement
between the companions to divide their gains has entirely disappeared,
perhaps because the secondary theme takes so large a place. The removal
of the poisonous habitants of the bride is clearly indicated, though it
has been weakened into a flogging, which is given, however, only just
in time to save the bridegroom from death. The subsequent milk bath
seems to show a conflict between the conclusions of the two subsidiary
motives&mdash;the end of <i>The Poison Maiden</i> being release from
something like demonic possession, and that of <i>The Water of Life</i>
in this form being release from a spell&mdash;though perhaps the bath
is only a reduplication of the purifying process.</p>
<p><i>Simrock X.</i> is not unlike the two variants just cited. A
king&rsquo;s son wastes his property, and is sent out to shift for
himself. He pays the debts of a naked corpse, and has only enough money
left to pay his reckoning at his inn. So he takes the body to a wood,
and buries it there. As he goes his way, he is met by a man, who
becomes his follower and secures three rods, a sword, and a pair of
wings from a dead raven. They come to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>a castle, where to win
the king&rsquo;s daughter the prince has to guess her thoughts for
three days in succession. The companion flies with her each night when
she goes to her wizard for counsel, and learns that the prince must say
&ldquo;bread,&rdquo; &ldquo;the princess&rsquo;s jewels,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;the wizard&rsquo;s head&rdquo; in turn. On the last night he
cuts off the wizard&rsquo;s head and brings it to his master, who
displays it at court and so breaks the spell. When the couple are
married, the companion explains that he is the spirit of the dead man,
and disappears.</p>
<p>This variant obviously belongs to the same type as those preceding.
As in <i>Irish I.</i> and <i>II.</i> the hero is a prince instead of a
youth of low birth; but there is no general uniformity in this trait.
The agreement of division and the violent dispossession of the heroine
have disappeared. Indeed, so far has <i>The Water of Life</i>
supplanted the other motives that the position of the tale is only
evident when it is placed side by side with other versions of the same
class. When so considered, however, the peculiar features of the
succession of feats by which the bride is won appear very prominently,
and establish the type.</p>
<p><i>Harz I.</i> stands closer to <i>Norwegian II.</i> than the
preceding. A youth pays his all for the burial of a poor man, whose
ghost joins him. They go to a city, where a bespelled princess kills
all her suitors who cannot answer a riddle. The companion spirit tells
the youth to save her, explaining his own identity. He gives wings and
an iron rod to the hero, who flies with the princess to a mountain
spirit, and hears that he must guess that she is thinking of her
father&rsquo;s white horse. The next night the youth follows her with
two rods and is thus enabled to guess that she is thinking of her
father&rsquo;s sword. The third night he follows her with two rods and
a sword, with which he cuts off the monster&rsquo;s head. This he shows
her in the morning when asked <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href=
"#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>the usual question, and so he breaks
the spell. On the wedding night he dips her thrice in water. The first
time she comes from the bath a raven, the second time a dove, and the
third time in her own shape, but purified.</p>
<p>The burial is here retained, but the agreement is entirely lost.
Though the variant follows <i>Norwegian II.</i> in general, even to
such details as the preliminary beating of the lady, and the bath of
final purification, the important trait of flogging the bride, by which
the hero is saved on the wedding night, has altogether disappeared.
Like <i>Simrock X.</i>, the tale has obscured the first of the two
secondary themes for the benefit of the second. Its position seems
sure, however, as a member of the little group now being
considered.</p>
<p><i>Jack the Giant-Killer</i> clearly belongs to this group,
approaching <i>Irish I.</i> in form. The earliest complete version that
I know is unfortunately not older than the eighteenth century, and
perhaps has lost several features of interest which might be found in
earlier forms. King Arthur&rsquo;s son sets forth to free a lady
possessed of seven spirits. At a market town in Wales he pays almost
all his money to release the body of a man who died in debt. He gives
his last twopence to an old woman, who meets him after he has left the
town. Jack the Giant-Killer is so pleased with these good deeds that he
becomes the prince&rsquo;s servant. They go to a giant&rsquo;s castle
together. Jack tells the giant that a mighty prince is coming<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e3740src" href="#xd20e3740" name=
"xd20e3740src">32</a> and locks him up, so that the two take all his
gold. Jack takes also an old coat and cap, a rusty sword, and a pair of
slippers. They arrive at the lady&rsquo;s house. She tells the prince
to show her in the morning a handkerchief, which she conceals in her
dress. By putting on the coat of darkness, and the shoes of swiftness,
and following her when she goes to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71"
href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>her demon lover, Jack gets the
handkerchief for his master. Next day the lady tells the prince to get
the lips which she will kiss the last that night. Jack follows her
again and cuts off the demon&rsquo;s head, which the prince produces,
thus breaking the spell that has bound her to the evil spirits.</p>
<p>This variant, even in what is probably a mutilated state, is
strikingly similar to <i>Irish I.</i> in such details as the means used
to follow the lady, and the tasks imposed upon the suitor. Indeed, the
fact that the adventures take place in Wales might lead one to suppose
that the story in this form was Celtic, were not the knowledge of it so
persistent in England also. Several features are obscured, at least in
the form from which I cite. Though the burial of the dead is given
clearly enough, and the fact that the lady is possessed is insisted on,
the prince is kind to an old woman as well as to a dead man, and Jack
is certainly not understood to be a ghost. All mention of an agreement
between the companions, and of the means taken to free the heroine from
her possession by dividing her or flogging her, has likewise
disappeared. However, the correspondence both in outline and in detail
with <i>Irish I.</i> is sufficient to establish the position of the
variant.</p>
<p>In the <i>Old Wives&rsquo; Tale</i> the theme of <i>The Grateful
Dead</i> is imbedded in such a mass of folk-lore and folk-tales that it
is quite impossible to restore adequately the narrative as Peele found
it. He treated the story as a literary artist, of course, modifying and
adding details to suit the scheme of his play. The outline of the
story, as Peele gives it, is as follows: A king, or a lord, or a duke,
has a daughter as white as snow and as red as blood, who is carried off
by a conjurer in the form of a dragon. Her two brothers set forth to
seek her, and by a cross meet an old man named Erestus, who calls
himself the White Bear of England&rsquo;s Wood. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>He, they
learn, has been enchanted by the conjurer, and is a man by day and a
bear by night. He tells them of his own troubles, and gives them good
advice. Later he is met by the wandering knight Eumenides, who likewise
is seeking the lady Delia and is counselled:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Bestowe thy almes, give more than all,</p>
<p class="line">Till dead men&rsquo;s bones come at thy
call.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Eumenides pays all his money except three farthings to
bury the body of Jack, while the conjurer compels Delia to goad her
brothers at the work to which he has set them. Eumenides is overtaken
by the ghost of Jack, who becomes his servant, or
&ldquo;copartner,&rdquo; provides him with money, and slays the
conjurer while invisible, thus breaking the spell of all the enchanted
persons. Jack then demands his half of Delia, refuses to take her
whole, and, when Eumenides prepares to cut her in twain, explains that
he has asked this only as a trial of constancy. He quickly
disappears.</p>
<p>Dutz has already shown<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3773src" href=
"#xd20e3773" name="xd20e3773src">33</a> that <i>Old Wives&rsquo;
Tale</i> has three of the essential features of <i>The Grateful
Dead</i>, viz.: the burial of the dead with the peculiar prophetic
advice of Erestus, the reward of the hero by assistance in getting a
wife, and the sharing of the woman. Because of the non-schematic nature
of his discussion he did not make any attempt to classify the variant
more specifically. In his edition of the play,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e3782src" href="#xd20e3782" name="xd20e3782src">34</a> Professor
Gummere, in indicating some of the folk-lore which Peele used, has
likewise called attention<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3788src" href=
"#xd20e3788" name="xd20e3788src">35</a> to the connection with our
theme. Of particular importance is his hint as to the likeness of the
variant to the story which I call <i>Irish III.</i> It is practicable,
however, to carry the matter somewhat further. The adventures of Delia,
Eumenides, and Jack are all that really concern us. It will be seen
that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>these conform in essentials to the type under
consideration. There is the burial, the agreement, the death of the
wizard, and the division. To be sure, as in other instances, the
dispossession of the woman has been obscured by other elements; yet the
type is unmistakable, it seems to me. One trait in particular connects
<i>Old Wives&rsquo; Tale</i> with <i>Irish I.</i> and <i>II.</i> In all
three the hero seeks a maiden who is white as snow and red as blood. On
the other hand, the ghost is called Jack as in <i>Irish III.</i> and
the English tale which bears Jack&rsquo;s name. Because of these
similarities and discrepancies one is forced to conclude that for this
part of his play Peele drew upon some version of <i>Jack the
Giant-Killer</i>, which was far better preserved than the forms known
to-day. His original must have had many points in common with the tale
as extant in Ireland, though we need not believe that he knew it in
other than English dress.</p>
<p>It yet remains to consider the relations of the two sets of variants
discussed in this chapter to <i>The Poison Maiden</i> and to one
another. The group is peculiar in that all the members of it are
folk-tales, save three: <i>Tobit, Danish III.</i> and <i>Old
Wives&rsquo; Tale</i>. The two latter are, however, immediately derived
from popular narratives of an easily discernible type. Thus
<i>Tobit</i> is an anomaly from almost any point of view, obscure in
its origin and possessed of only trivial influence upon the other tales
belonging to the same group. Of the twenty-six variants, fifteen have
<i>The Grateful Dead</i> + <i>The Poison Maiden</i> simply, while the
other eleven add thereto more or less distinct elements of <i>The Water
of Life</i>.</p>
<p>In the following versions the hero is saved on the wedding night, or
the bride is purified by some means: <i>Tobit, Armenian, Gypsy,
Siberian, Russian I., Russian II., Russian III., Russian IV., Russian
V., Russian VI., Servian II., Servian III., Servian IV., Bulgarian,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>Esthonian II., Irish I., Irish II., Danish III.,
Norwegian II.</i>, and <i>Harz I.</i> Not all the stories which I have
placed in the group, it will be observed, have this feature; but, out
of all the variants of <i>The Grateful Dead</i> enumerated in the
bibliographical list, not one has it except members of the group. Now
this purification of the bride, by means of which the hero is saved, is
precisely the element of <i>The Poison Maiden</i> which is most
essential. There can be no doubt, therefore, that this theme actually
united with a more primitive form of <i>The Grateful Dead</i> to form
the compound discussed in this chapter. The combination must have been
made very early and in Asia, as <i>Tobit</i> and <i>Armenian</i> bear
witness. It will be noted that all the variants, save <i>Finnish</i>,
which have the simple compound, retain the rescue of the bridegroom,
while only half of those where a subsidiary motive has been introduced
have the like. Apparently the intrusion of new matter of a very
romantic sort tended to obscure the original climax of the combined
type.</p>
<p>Another feature of much importance in this connection is the
division of the woman, or whatever is substituted for it. In a large
majority of the variants studied, which have the trait at all, the
purpose of the division proposed or accomplished is to test the
fidelity of the hero. Hippe believed<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e3868src" href="#xd20e3868" name="xd20e3868src">36</a> that this
was a modification of the original trait, an opinion which would be
justified if the compound type <i>The Grateful Dead</i> + <i>The Poison
Maiden</i> only were considered. The versions which have the
purification are the following: <i>Armenian, Gypsy</i>, <i>Siberian,
Russian II., Russian IV., Russian V., Russian VI., Servian II., Servian
III., Servian IV., Bulgarian</i>, <i>Esthonian II., Finnish, Irish I.,
Irish II.</i>, and <i>Old Wives&rsquo; Tale</i>. In these the purpose
of the division, or beating, whether actually performed or not, is the
disposal of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>serpents or other venomous creatures by which the
woman is possessed.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3892src" href=
"#xd20e3892" name="xd20e3892src">37</a> It will be noted, however, that
all of these variants are of the type treated in the present chapter.
If the division for the sake of purification were then regarded as more
primitive and older than the division for the sake of sharing the gains
or of testing the hero, it would naturally follow that all the combined
types must proceed from <i>The Grateful Dead</i> + <i>The Poison
Maiden</i>. Hippe followed the logical course from his premises in so
regarding the relationship of the groups.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e3907src" href="#xd20e3907" name="xd20e3907src">38</a> However, it
seems clear to me&mdash;and it will be increasingly evident as we study
the other groups&mdash;that the division for purification belongs
solely to the compound treated in this chapter. It would follow
logically from combining <i>The Poison Maiden</i>, where a friend saves
the hero from the fatal embraces of a woman, with <i>The Grateful
Dead</i>, where the hero is willing to divide his wife to satisfy the
agreement which he has made with his benefactor. Only by such an
explanation is it possible to account for the development of the
several groups from a common root. The barbarous character of the
division for purification, and the softening which it has undergone in
the group which we have been studying, give it an appearance of
antiquity to which it has no right. In point of fact, it belongs only
to this group, which is thus clearly set off from all the others as an
independent branch. The division for the sake of fulfilling an
obligation is more widespread, though it has suffered many
modifications. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=

Asiatic parallels not cited by Hertz will serve to illustrate the theme
further. One of these is &ldquo;The Story of Swet-Basanta&rdquo; from
Lal Behari Day, <i>Folk-tales of Bengal</i>, 1883, pp. 100 f. The hero
is found by an elephant and made king of a land, where the successive
sovereigns are killed every night mysteriously. He watches and sees
something like a thread coming from the queen&rsquo;s nostrils. This
proves to be a great serpent, which he kills, thus remaining as king.
The other is from J. H. Knowles, <i>Folk-tales of Kashmir</i>, 1888,
pp. 32 ff., &ldquo;A Lach of Rupees for a Bit of Advice.&rdquo; A
prince pays a lach of rupees for a paper containing four rules of
conduct. His father exiles him for this extravagance. In his wanderings
the prince finds a potter alternately laughing and crying because his
son must soon marry a princess, who has to be wedded anew each night.
So the prince marries the woman instead and kills two serpents that
come from her nostrils, thus retaining the kingdom. In these two
stories there is no question of aid coming to the hero; he is saved by
his own watchfulness.</p>

"xd20e3929src" href="#xd20e3929" name="xd20e3929src">1</a> Simrock
regarded as an essential feature of <i>The Grateful Dead</i> the
release of a maiden from captivity by the hero. Stephens and
Hippe<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3935src" href="#xd20e3935" name=
"xd20e3935src">2</a> saw that such was not the case. The latter&rsquo;s
treatment of the matter<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3938src" href=
"#xd20e3938" name="xd20e3938src">3</a> leaves little to be desired as
far as it goes, save that it implies a derivation of the compound
<i>The Grateful Dead</i> + <i>The Ransomed Woman</i> from the compound
treated in the last chapter&mdash;a view which I believe erroneous.</p>
<p><i>The Ransomed Woman</i> appears as a separate tale or in
combination with other themes than <i>The Grateful Dead</i> more than
once. A prolonged study of the motive would probably yield a rich
harvest of examples, though it is sufficient for the present purpose to
refer to Hippe&rsquo;s article as establishing the existence of the
form. His Wendish folk-tale<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3955src" href=
"#xd20e3955" name="xd20e3955src">4</a> and <i lang="de">Guter

of themselves evidence enough.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3961src"

anything whatever to do with <i>The Grateful Dead</i>.<a class=

The characteristics <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77"
name="pb77">77</a>]</span>of <i>The Ransomed Woman</i> will appear as
we consider the compound type, which contains folk-tales almost
exclusively, as was the case with the type studied in the previous
chapter, but in most cases from Western Europe instead of from both
Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>Nineteen variants have <i>The Grateful Dead</i> and <i>The Ransomed
Woman</i> combined in a comparatively simple form without admixture
with related themes. These are: <i>Servian I., Lithuanian
I.</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4013src" href="#xd20e4013" name=
"xd20e4013src">7</a> <i>Hungarian II., Transylvanian</i>, <i>Catalan,
Spanish, Trancoso, Nicholas, Gasconian</i>, <i>Straparola I., Istrian,
Gaelic, Breton III.</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4026src" href=
"#xd20e4026" name="xd20e4026src">8</a> <i>Swedish, Norwegian I.,
Icelandic I.</i> and <i>II.</i>, and <i>Simrock IV.</i> and
<i>VI.</i></p>
<p>In <i>Servian I.</i> a merchant&rsquo;s son, while on a journey,
ransoms a company of slaves whom he finds in the hands of freebooters.
Among them is a beautiful maiden with her nurse. He marries the lady,
who proves to be the daughter of an emperor. On a second voyage he
ransoms two peasants, who have been imprisoned for not paying their
taxes to the emperor. On his third journey he comes to his
father-in-law&rsquo;s court, and is sent back for his wife. He is,
however, cast into the sea by a former lover of the princess, and
succeeds in getting ashore on a lonely island, where he remains for
fifteen days and fifteen nights.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4049src"
href="#xd20e4049" name="xd20e4049src">9</a> Then an angel in the
disguise of an old man appears to him, and, on condition of receiving
half of his possessions, brings him to court, where he is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>reunited
with his wife. After renouncing his claim, the old man explains who he
is, and disappears.</p>
<p>The most striking peculiarity of the variant is the loss of the
burial, for which appears rather awkwardly the ransoming of some
peasants on the hero&rsquo;s second voyage. That substitution has
occurred is apparent, however, both from the clumsiness of the device
by which the original trait is replaced, and from the angel in the form
of an old man, who takes the r&ocirc;le of the ghost. It will be
remembered that the same substitution has already been met with in the
case of <i>Tobit</i> and <i>Russian II.</i></p>
<p>In <i>Lithuanian I.</i> is found a variant which, as we shall find,
is of a common type. A king&rsquo;s son pays three hundred gold-pieces,
all that he possesses, to release a dead man from his creditors and
have him buried. The hero then becomes a merchant, and finds a princess
on an island, whither she has been driven by a storm. He takes her to a
city, where he makes his home, and marries her. A messenger, sent out
by her father to seek her, arrives, takes them aboard ship, and pitches
the hero into the sea in order to obtain the offered reward. He is
saved by a man in a boat, who says that he is the ghost of the dead,
and instructs him how to rejoin his bride. So everything ends
happily.</p>
<p>The events as here related follow a very normal course, which is
repeated again and again in stories of this type: a burial, a ransom,
an act of treachery, a rescue by the ghost, and a happy reunion of the
lovers. The agreement between the hero and the ghost, which is found in
<i>Servian I.</i>, and very frequently elsewhere, is lacking, however.
A peculiarity of the variant is the change in status of the hero. He is
a prince, but becomes a merchant, thus uniting the two characters given
him in the other tales of this class.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian II.</i> is in some respects more interesting than the
variant just cited. A merchant&rsquo;s son while in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>Turkey
pays the debts and for the burial of a mistreated corpse. After
returning home, he goes to England and rescues a French princess with
her two maids, but by his cunning saves the gold that he has agreed to
pay for them. At her bidding he goes to Paris and tells the king that
she is safe. On his return to bring her to her home, where he is to
marry her, he is placed on a desert island by a general who is
enamoured of the princess. Thence he is rescued by an old man, the
ghost of the dead, who takes him to the Continent. He goes to Paris,
where he is <span class="corr" id="xd20e4078" title=
"Source: recognised">recognized</span> by the princess, when he drops a
ring that she has given him into a beaker. When she comes to him in his
room, he threatens to kill her if she does not go away; but when she
agrees that he has the right to do so since he has saved her life, he
says that his threat was only a test of loyalty. So the story ends
happily.</p>
<p>The course of events is not very different from that of
<i>Lithuanian I.</i>, since the variant has all the normal elements
save the agreement between the ghost and the hero. A peculiarity is the
final scene in which the hero tests his lady. It will be evident, I
think, that this is an obscured and modified form of the test to which
the ghost elsewhere submits the hero, a test of fidelity likewise,
though different in its nature.</p>
<p>In the <i>Transylvanian</i> variant, a merchant&rsquo;s son while on
a journey pays fifty florins, half of his capital, for the burial of a
dead man. On a second journey he pays one hundred florins, again
one-half of his store, for the ransom of a princess who has been
imprisoned while out doing charity <i>incognito</i>. She gives him a
ring and sends him to the castle, where her father turns him out of
doors. He then meets an old man&mdash;the ghost&mdash;and promises him
one-half of his gains after seven years for his help. He is then
enabled to marry the princess, who recognizes him, at the castle by his
ring. They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>have two children. When the old man comes back at
the end of seven years, the hero gives up one of his children, and,
after offering her whole, is ready to divide his wife. The old man
renounces his claim, and disappears.</p>
<p>Every step in the narrative is here clearly marked, even to the
conditional agreement with the ghost, which so frequently is wanting.
The variant thus appears to be entirely normal as far as <i>The
Grateful Dead</i> goes, though it does not have the rescue by the
ghost&mdash;an important feature of <i>The Ransomed Woman</i>.</p>
<p>In <i>Catalan</i><a class="noteref" id="xd20e4109src" href=
"#xd20e4109" name="xd20e4109src">10</a> a young man on a journey has a
poor man buried at his expense, and ransoms a princess. Later he goes
to the court of her parents with a flag on which she has embroidered
her name. They <span class="corr" id="xd20e4112" title=
"Source: recognise">recognize</span> this, and send the youth back for
the lady. On the way he is cast into the sea by the sailors, but is
saved by the thankful dead and brought to the court again, where he
espouses the princess.</p>
<p>In <i>Spanish</i><a class="noteref" id="xd20e4119src" href=
"#xd20e4119" name="xd20e4119src">11</a> a young Venetian merchant pays
the debts of a Christian at Tunis, and has him buried. At the house of
the creditor he also buys a Christian slave girl. He takes her back to
Venice and marries her. At the wedding a sea-captain recognizes the
lady, and lures the couple aboard his ship. The young man is cast into
the sea, but by clinging to a plank reaches land, where he lives seven
months with a hermit. At the end of that time he is sent to the coast,
where he finds a ship, and is transported to Ireland. There he is
entrusted by the captain with two letters to the king. The one says
that he is a great physician, who will heal the sick princess; the
other that the plank, the hermit, and the captain who has brought him
to Ireland are one and all the ghost of the man whom he buried. The
hero is recognized at court by the princess, who has <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>been
brought thither by the traitor, and has explained all to her
father.</p>
<p>In these tales the theme of <i>The Grateful Dead</i> is somewhat
abbreviated for the sake of the romantic features of the secondary
motive. In both, the agreement with the ghost and every trace of a
division have disappeared, though they differ in the details of the
treachery by which the lovers are separated. In the former<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e4130src" href="#xd20e4130" name=
"xd20e4130src">12</a> much is made of the manner by which the hero gets
a favourable reception at the court of the princess&rsquo;s father,
while in the latter this is suppressed. Recognition by some such means,
it will appear, is an important feature of the majority of the variants
in this section. It must be remembered, of course, that <i>Spanish</i>
is a semi-literary version, even though popular in origin.</p>
<p><i>Trancoso</i>, the work of a sixteenth century Portuguese
story-teller, is even more consciously literary. It shows, besides, the
tendency of the narrative to take on a religious colouring. The son of
a Lusitanian merchant, while in Fez on a trading expedition, buys the
relics of a Christian saint. In spite of his father&rsquo;s anger, he
does this a second time, and is so successful in retailing the bones
that he is sent out a third time with instructions to buy as many
relics as possible. On this expedition, however, he succeeds merely in
ransoming a Christian girl, whom he takes home. At her request he
carries to the King of England a piece of linen, on which she has
embroidered the story of her adventures. He learns that she is the
king&rsquo;s daughter, and restores her to her father. Subsequently he
wanders over Europe in despair, for he has hoped to marry the princess,
till he meets with two minstrels, who accompany him to the English
court. There he makes himself known to the princess <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>by a
song; and, by the aid of the two minstrels, he wins her hand in a
tournament. Later the two friends reveal themselves as the saints whose
bones he had rescued from the Moors.</p>
<p>Though this version clearly belongs in the category now under
discussion, it has certain features that can be explained only on the
supposition that Trancoso altered his source to suit his personal
fancy. The clever substitute for actual burial, the duplication of that
trait (which occurs nowhere else), the humorous touch with reference to
the hero&rsquo;s success in selling relics, and the appearance of the
ghosts as minstrels, are all strokes of individual invention. The
wanderings of the hero and his manner of revealing himself to the
princess are doubtless reminiscences from the popular romances of
Spain, while the tournament probably comes, as Men&eacute;ndez y Pelayo
hints,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4144src" href="#xd20e4144" name=
"xd20e4144src">13</a> from an earlier version of our theme,
<i>Oliver</i>, which will be treated below. In spite of these
peculiarities, the ordinary features of the combined theme are not more
obscured than in the two preceding variants. The agreement, the
division, and the rescue are the only ones that disappear.</p>
<p>In the fourteenth century variant from <i>Scala Celi</i>,
<i>Nicholas</i>, our story is altogether transformed into a legend. The
only son of a widow<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4160src" href=
"#xd20e4160" name="xd20e4160src">14</a> of Bordeaux is sent as a
merchant to a distant city with fifty pounds. He gives it all to help
rebuild a church of St Nicholas, and returns home empty-handed. Much
later he is sent out with one hundred pounds, and buys the
Sultan&rsquo;s daughter. His mother disowns him, and he is supported by
the embroidery which the princess makes. With her wares he goes to a
festival at Alexandria, but, at her bidding, keeps away from the
castle. When he journeys to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href=
"#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>Alexandria a second time, however, he
goes to the castle and is imprisoned, as the handiwork of the princess
is recognized. She is sent for, while the hero is released and goes
home. Since he does not find the maiden there, he returns to Alexandria
with a piece of embroidery which she has sent him, meets her, and
elopes by the aid of St. Nicholas, who sends them a ship
opportunely.</p>
<p>Because of its legendary character the variant has been materially
transformed, but not beyond recognition. The thankful dead is replaced
by the saint throughout, so that the burial is altered into church
building, and both the agreement and the division of the gains
disappear. The various elements of <i>The Ransomed Woman</i> fare
better: the act of treachery done the hero is the only one lacking, and
that perhaps is replaced by his imprisonment in the Sultan&rsquo;s
castle. It is remarkable that the details of the narrative have been so
little altered in spite of its complete change of purpose.</p>
<p>In the <i>Gasconian</i> folk-tale Jean du Boucau, the son of a
mariner, goes to fight the corsairs. On the shore of the sea he rescues
a man named Uartia, who is pretending death to escape from his
creditors. Later this man becomes a prosperous freebooter, and is
sailing with a load of captives when met again by Jean. The latter is
so shocked by his evil deeds that he encloses him in the coffin
prepared for him on the previous occasion, and throws him into the sea.
Jean then marries the most beautiful of the captives, who is the
daughter of the King of Bilbao.</p>
<p>The variant is excessively rationalized, it will be observed, and
most traces of <i>The Grateful Dead</i> have disappeared. Though
various substitutions for the burial are found in each of the groups,
this is the only case that I know where the man plays &rsquo;possum to
escape his creditors. The story is likewise unique in making the hero
take vengeance on the man whom he has helped <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>earlier,
and accordingly in making him rescue the maiden from the hands of the
person who is in the character of the thankful dead. The variant has
been modified by a free fancy; yet its position in the group remains
perfectly clear in spite of the loss of such traits as the agreement,
the act of treachery, the rescue of the hero, and the division of the
gains.</p>
<p><i>Straparola I.</i>, one of the Italian novelist&rsquo;s two
renderings of our theme, is far more normal than the above, and is
probably based directly on a folk-story. Bertuccio pays one hundred
ducats to free a corpse from a robber and bury it, greatly to his
mother&rsquo;s disgust. He goes out again with two hundred ducats, and
pays them for the ransom of the daughter of the King of Navarre. His
mother is still more angry. The princess is taken home to Navarre by
officers of the court who have been searching for her, but first she
tells Bertuccio to come to her, and to hold his hand to his head as a
sign when he hears that she is to be married. On his way to Navarre he
meets a knight who gives him a horse and clothing on condition of his
returning them, together with half of his gains. He marries the
princess, and is returning home, when he meets the knight again and
offers to give up his wife whole rather than kill her by division.
Whereupon the knight explains that he is the spirit of the dead, and
resigns his claim.</p>
<p>All the traits previously mentioned are here evident save the act of
treachery by which the hero comes near losing his bride. The sign
appears as a means of communication between the lovers, as in
<i>Transylvanian</i> and elsewhere. The question of division is simply
a matter of fulfilling a bargain, but it shows how easily by a slight
shift of emphasis the test of loyalty could be made the important
element.</p>
<p>None of the Italian folk variants, which I know, conforms to the
above closely enough to be regarded as a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>near relative.
<i>Istrian</i>, however, belongs in the same category. A youth called
Fair Brow sets out to trade with six thousand <i>scudi</i>, which he
pays to bury a debtor on the shore, for whom passers-by are giving
alms. On his return home, he tells his father that he has been robbed,
and again is sent out with six thousand <i>scudi</i>. He pays these for
a maiden, who has been stolen from the Sultan, and he is consequently
disowned by his father. After his marriage to the girl, the young
couple live by the sale of the wife&rsquo;s paintings. Some sailors of
the Sultan see these, and carry the lady off home. Fair Brow goes
fishing with an old man whom he meets by the sea. They are driven by a
storm to Turkey, and are sold to the Sultan as slaves, but they escape
with the wife and considerable treasure. The old man then asks for a
division of the property, even of the woman. When the hero offers him
three-quarters of the wealth in order to keep the woman, the old man
declares that he is the ghost, and disappears.</p>
<p>All of the essential traits, except the preliminary agreement and
the rescue of the hero, are here clearly marked. The latter is, indeed,
probably accounted for by the storm which the hero and the ghost
encounter together. The fact that the young couple live by the sale of
the wife&rsquo;s handiwork, and that this in some way or other leads to
her restoration to her parents or earlier connections, is an important
feature of <i>The Ransomed Woman</i>, being found clearly in the
Wendish tale as well as in many variants of the compound type.</p>
<p><i>Gaelic</i> is an interesting example of the theme. Iain, the son
of a Barra widow, becomes the master of a ship and goes to Turkey,
where he pays the debts of a dead Christian and buries the corpse. He
ransoms a Christian maiden, the daughter of the King of Spain, with her
servant, on the same journey, and takes her back to England, together
with much gold. At her advice he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86"
href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>goes to Spain and attends
church, where the king recognizes by his clothing, his ring, his book,
and his whistle that he has news of the lost princess. Iain then
returns to England for the maiden, whom he is to marry. While going
with her to Spain he is left on a desert island by a general, who has
secreted himself on the ship; but after a time he is rescued by a man
in a boat, to whom he promises half of his wife and of his children, if
he shall have any. In Spain the princess, who has gone mad, recognizes
him when he plays his whistle. So they are married, and the general
burned. When three sons have been born, the rescuer appears and asks
for his share; but as soon as Iain accedes he declares himself to be
the ghost, and disappears.</p>
<p>Apart from the dressing of the story, which is unusually good, the
variant follows the normal course. The several signs by which the hero
is recognized by the king and the princess mark the imaginative wealth
of the Celt, though the appearance of a ring, and the fact that the
hero is left on a desert island by an infatuated general, show a close
correspondence with <i>Hungarian II.</i> The introduction of the
children as part of the property to be divided is interesting, since it
shows the connecting link by which the simple compound now under
consideration passed into combination with the theme of <i>The Two
Friends</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4224src" href="#xd20e4224"
name="xd20e4224src">15</a> <i>Gaelic</i>, however, clearly belongs
where it is here placed. The healing of the princess at the
hero&rsquo;s coming reminds one of the similar trait in
<i>Spanish</i>.</p>
<p><i>Breton III.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd20e4239src" href=
"#xd20e4239" name="xd20e4239src">16</a> is peculiar in several ways. A
young man, who had been unjustly cast off by his parents, put himself
under the protection of St. Corentin and the Virgin. To an old woman he
gave all his stock of money that she might bury her husband and have
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>masses said for his soul. The saint and the Virgin
then led the hero to a nobleman, whose daughter he married. On a hunt
he was cast into the sea by an envious uncle of his wife, at a time
when she was pregnant; but he was brought to an island by some
mysterious power and nourished there for five years by St. Corentin.
Finally an old man appeared and took him home after he had promised
half of his possessions to the rescuer. When a year had passed, the old
man came back and demanded half of the child; but just as the
mysterious stranger was about to divide the child St. Corentin and the
Virgin appeared and explained their identity, together with that of the
old man, who was the saint himself. They told the hero, furthermore,
that God was well pleased with him, and would take his son and himself
to Paradise. Father and son fell dead immediately, while the wife went
into a convent.</p>
<p>This tale, like <i>Nicholas</i>, has been dressed up as a legend,
chiefly in the praise of St. Corentin, with the result that the
elements are confused. The burial, however, persists, though the
ransoming of the woman has been feebly replaced by the aid of the saint
and the Virgin. The hero is cast into the sea by an avaricious uncle of
the bride, again a weakened trait. The rescue and the agreement to
divide are normal in essentials, though adorned with superfluous
miracles, as is again the conclusion of the tale. It illustrates how
easily such a narrative may be adapted, whether consciously or not, to
a religious purpose. The division of the child, which comes in
question, is of precisely the same character as in <i>Gaelic</i>; it
does not imply the presence of a new motive, though it indicates the
possibility of a new combination.</p>
<p><i>Swedish</i><a class="noteref" id="xd20e4255src" href="#xd20e4255"
name="xd20e4255src">17</a> is a somewhat abbreviated form of the normal
type. Pelle B&aring;tsman, while on a journey, pays <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>the
debts of a dead man, and so brings repose to him; for he has been
hunted from his grave and soundly beaten every night by his creditors,
who are likewise dead. Pelle then falls in with robbers, with whom he
finds the daughter of the King of Armenia. He escapes with her, and
goes on board a ship to seek her father, but he is thrown overboard by
the envious captain. He is saved by the thankful dead and brought to
Armenia, where he marries the princess. Here the burial is peculiar in
that the dead man is harassed by creditors who are already dead. This
is a marvel, which need excite no surprise in view of the modifications
of the trait found elsewhere. The ransom in this case does not imply a
money payment, since the hero escapes from robbers with the maiden. The
way in which the hero is left behind by the master of the vessel on
which the lovers sail is a trait similar to the one in <i>Catalan</i>
and <i>Spanish</i>. The agreement between the hero and the ghost, the
sign employed by the hero, and the division of gains are all lacking;
but no new feature replaces them.</p>
<p><i>Norwegian I.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd20e4269src" href=
"#xd20e4269" name="xd20e4269src">18</a> is not very different from the
preceding tale. A man in the service of a merchant pays all he has,
while on one voyage, to bury the body of a dead man. On his next voyage
he ransoms a princess, and sets out with her for England. On the way
she is carried off by her brother and a former suitor. The hero
overtakes them and is given a ring by the lady, but is cast into the
sea by the suitor. For seven years he lives on a desert isle, till an
old man appears, tells him that it is the princess&rsquo;s bridal day,
carries him to England, and gives him a flask. This the hero sends to
his lady, is thus recognized, and is married. The agreement with the
ghost and the division of the woman are entirely lacking, though the
burial, the ransom, the treachery of the suitor, and the aid of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>the ghost <span class="corr" id="xd20e4274" title=
"Source: apppear">appear</span> in normal fashion. The sign enters only
as a means of communication between the lovers. The tale thus has no
very unusual traits.</p>
<p><i>Icelandic I.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd20e4280src" href=
"#xd20e4280" name="xd20e4280src">19</a> is a fuller, and, for our
purpose, more interesting variant than the last. Thorsteinn, a
king&rsquo;s son, who has wasted his substance, sells his kingdom and
sets forth into the world. He pays two hundred rix-dollars to free from
debt a dead man, whose grave is beaten every day by a creditor to
destroy his rest. The prince goes on, and in the castle of a giant
finds a princess hanging by the hair. He frees her, and is taking her
home when he meets Raudr, a knight to whom her hand has been promised
if he can find her. Raudr puts the prince to sea alone in a boat and
carries the lady home. Thorsteinn, however, is brought thither also by
the ghost and is recognized by the princess, when she is about to be
married to the traitor. So Raudr is punished, and Thorsteinn obtains
the princess.</p>
<p>Here, again, the agreement, the sign, and the division do not
appear, though the version is otherwise normal. To be sure, the ransom
of the lady is replaced by a rescue, as in <i>Swedish</i>, and the
beating of the grave preserves a bit of northern superstition, which is
interesting even though not primitive as far as our tale is
concerned.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4289src" href="#xd20e4289" name=
"xd20e4289src">20</a></p>
<p><i>Icelandic II.</i> is similar to the variant just cited in several
particulars, though it has important differences. Vilhj&aacute;lmur, a
merchant&rsquo;s son, loses his property and becomes the servant of
twelve robbers. In their den he finds a princess named &Aacute;sa
hanging by the hair. He escapes with her by sea, taking along the
thieves&rsquo; treasure. This he pays to have the body of a debtor
buried. To <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>the haven where this happens comes Rau&eth;ur in
search of the princess, takes the couple on his ship, but puts the hero
to sea in a rudderless boat. A man appears to Vilhj&aacute;lmur in a
dream, saying that he is the ghost of the man whom he has buried, and
that he will bring him to land and show him treasure. So the hero is
brought to the land of the princess and tells his story at the wedding
of the traitor with the princess. Thus the bride is won for him.</p>
<p>The hero, it will be observed, is a merchant instead of a prince, as
in <i>Icelandic I.</i>, and the burial of the dead is customary in form
though exceptionally placed in the narrative. Otherwise the two
variants correspond rather closely, even in such a detail as the name
of the traitor. There is the same omission of elements peculiar to
<i>The Grateful Dead</i>, the same preponderance of the secondary
motive, found in all the northern versions of this particular group.
The two Icelandic variants seem to be perfectly distinct, though they
are nearly related.</p>
<p>The two German folk-tales which fall into this group are not very
different from one another. In <i>Simrock IV.</i> a merchant&rsquo;s
son pays the debts of a man who is being devoured by dogs, but does not
succeed in saving his life. He goes on, finds two maidens exposed on a
rock, and takes them home. In spite of his father&rsquo;s objections,
he marries one of them. He goes to sea again, wearing a ring that his
wife has given him, and carrying a flag marked with her name. Coming to
the royal court of her father, he is sent back for the princess with a
minister. On his voyage to court again he is put overboard by the
minister, who hopes thus to win the princess. However, he is cast up on
an island, where the ghost of the dead man appears to him in sleep and
transports him miraculously to court. There he is recognized by his
ring and reunited to his wife.</p>
<p>Details such as those concerning the burial, the rescue <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>of the
lady, and the help given miraculously by the ghost mark the
independence of the variant, though they do not alter the normal course
of the narrative. As so often in this group, the agreement with the
ghost and the division are entirely lacking.</p>
<p>In <i>Simrock VI.</i> the variations from the normal are even
slighter. Heinrich of Hamburg buys a beautiful maiden in a foreign
land. On the sea-coast, when he is returning home with her, he pays the
debts of a corpse and has it buried. He wishes to marry the girl, but
she asks that he delay the wedding for a year and make a journey first.
So she gives him two coffers, with which he crosses the sea. By the
help of a shipman he finds his betrothed&rsquo;s royal father, but on
his way back to fetch her home is cast overboard by the mariner, who is
the original kidnapper of the maiden. This man gets her and carries her
to the court with the hope of marrying her. The hero is saved from the
sea, however, by the ghost of the dead man, who brings him to the
garden of the princess&rsquo;s palace, where he is found by his
bride.</p>
<p>The order of the burial and the ransoming<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e4324src" href="#xd20e4324" name="xd20e4324src">21</a> is here
reversed, but the facts are given in the ordinary form. Otherwise the
variant does not differ essentially from the preceding.</p>
<p>In <i>Transylvanian</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4344src" href=
"#xd20e4344" name="xd20e4344src">22</a> and more clearly in
<i>Gaelic</i> and <i>Breton III.</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e4353src" href="#xd20e4353" name="xd20e4353src">23</a> a tendency
has been remarked to introduce the children of the hero as part of the
gains which he is asked to divide with the thankful ghost. In a series
of tales belonging to the general type <i>The Grateful Dead</i> +
<i>The Ransomed Woman</i> this tendency has been accentuated so far
that it seems best to group them together, because of their approach to
the theme of <i>The Two Friends</i>. Since an actual combination of
this motive <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>with <i>The Grateful Dead</i> in its simple form
is found in only three variants, all of them literary, it will perhaps
be best to discuss the relationship of the main to the minor theme at
this point.</p>
<p><i>The Two Friends</i> is the chief motive of <i>Amis and
Amiloun</i>, which in its various forms<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e4378src" href="#xd20e4378" name="xd20e4378src">24</a> is the
mediaeval epic of ideal friendship. Its essential feature, as far as
the present study is concerned, is the sacrifice of his two sons by
Amis to cure the leprosy of Amiloun. They are actually slain, but are
miraculously brought to life again by the power of God. This story,
which exercised a powerful influence on the imagination of European
peoples, easily became connected with the sacrifice of his wife by the
hero of <i>The Grateful Dead</i>.</p>
<p>The three variants with the simple compound, or forming a group on
that basis, are those entered in the bibliography as <i>Lope de Vega,
Calderon</i>, and <i>Oliver</i>.</p>
<p>The plot of <i>Oliver</i> runs as follows<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e4409src" href="#xd20e4409" name="xd20e4409src">25</a>: Oliver,
the son of the King of Castille, becomes the close friend of Arthur of
Algarbe, the son of his stepmother. When he has grown up, he flees from
home because of the love which the queen declares for him, leaving to
Arthur a vial in which the water would grow dark, were he to come into
danger. He is shipwrecked while on his way to Constantinople, but,
together with another knight, is saved miraculously by a stag, which
carries them to England. Talbot, the other knight, is ill, and asks
Oliver to take him to his home at Canterbury, where he dies. Because of
debts that his parents will not pay he cannot be buried in consecrated
ground till Oliver himself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href=
"#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>attends to the matter. The hero then
starts for a tourney where the hand of the king&rsquo;s daughter is the
prize. On the way he loses his horse and money, but is supplied anew by
a mysterious knight, on condition of receiving half of what he gets at
the tourney. Here he is victor, and after a further successful war in
Ireland marries the princess, who bears him two children. While hunting
he is taken prisoner by the King of Ireland and placed in a dungeon.
Arthur, who is acting as regent in Spain, notices that the vial has
grown dark, and sets out to rescue his brother. In Ireland he is
wounded by a dragon, but is healed by a white knight, who notices his
resemblance to Oliver, and takes him to London to solace the princess.
He only escapes her embraces by the pretence of a vow, and sets forth
to deliver Oliver. On their way back he tells of his visit at London,
and so excites Oliver&rsquo;s jealousy, who leaves him. At home,
however, Oliver discovers his mistake, and determines to find his
brother, who, after a punitive expedition into Ireland, falls gravely
ill. Oliver learns in a dream that Arthur can only be cured by the
blood of his children, whom he slays accordingly. On his return home,
however, he finds them as well as ever. Later appears the mysterious
knight to demand his share of wife and children, as well as of all his
property. As Oliver raises his sword to divide his wife, he is told to
desist, since his loyalty is proved. The knight then explains that he
is the ghost of Talbot. Later Arthur marries Oliver&rsquo;s daughter,
and eventually unites the kingdoms of England, Castille, and
Algarbe.</p>
<p><i>Oliver</i> has certain elements not to be accounted for by the
combination of <i>The Two Friends</i> with <i>The Grateful Dead</i>.
Such are the motive of the hero&rsquo;s journey, for example, which
allies it with the tales of incestuous step-mothers; and the tourney in
which the hero wins his bride. Yet the burial of the dead man
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>(here a knight and a friend of the
hero&rsquo;s)<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4427src" href="#xd20e4427"
name="xd20e4427src">26</a> corresponds to the normal form of the
episode in that Oliver pays the creditors and the sum necessary for the
man&rsquo;s interment. So, too, the demand made by the ghost for half
of all that has been won runs true to the original form. The
distinctive trait of <i>Amis and Amiloun</i>, at the same time, comes
out more clearly than in the case of such folk-tales as
<i>Gaelic</i>&mdash;the hero actually kills his little children to save
the life of his old friend and foster-brother. One factor leads me to
think that the romance and the two romantic plays are to be regarded as
forms of the general type treated in this chapter, with additions from
other stories. The ghost rescues the hero from imprisonment A rescue of
the sort&mdash;normally after the hero has been cast into the sea or
left behind by his rival&mdash;is characteristic of <i>The Grateful
Dead</i> + <i>The Ransomed Woman</i>. In <i>Oliver</i> this rescue
takes place, to be sure, after the marriage instead of before, which is
the normal order, yet it is a factor of considerable importance. The
romance takes a position somewhat apart; and even though this is partly
due to the literary handling which it has undergone, it must remain
doubtfully classed with the immediate circle of variants belonging to
the compound type.</p>
<p>The position of the play by <i>Lope de Vega</i> is involved with
that of <i>Oliver</i>. Don Juan de Castro flees to England because of
the unlawful love of his stepmother, the Princess of Galicia. His ship
is wrecked on the English coast, and the captain, Tibaldo, is cast
ashore in a dying condition. To free the latter&rsquo;s mind from
unrest, Don Juan pays his debts of two thousand ducats, though this is
half of the hero&rsquo;s possessions. He hears that the princess
Clarinda is promised to anyone of princely blood who wins an
approaching tournament. While he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95"
href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>is sorrowful that he cannot
enter the contest, because of his poverty, the ghost of Tibaldo appears
to him one night and promises the necessary equipment on condition of
receiving one-half the gains. The next morning he finds everything
ready and wins the princess. He is later taken prisoner by one of the
contestants through a ruse, and is carried off to Ireland. By the
ghost&rsquo;s advice, his stepbrother and double comes to London and
takes his place, while Don Juan is freed by force of arms and restored
to his wife. After some years, when the couple have two children, the
stepbrother falls ill of a dreadful malady, which can only be cured,
Don Juan learns in a dream, by the blood of his children. So he slays
them and gives their blood to the sick man to drink. They are found
alive by a miracle; but Don Juan is troubled, and does not find rest
till the ghost appears and tells him that the only remedy for his
affliction is to fulfil his promise of a division. The hero prepares to
divide his wife, when the ghost stops him and explains that the demand
was only a test.</p>
<p>As Schaeffer pointed out,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4458src" href=
"#xd20e4458" name="xd20e4458src">27</a> Lope&rsquo;s plot is clearly
taken from <i>Oliver</i>, probably from the Spanish translation issued
in 1499. Indeed, the drama follows the romance with far more fidelity
than could have been expected of such an adaptation. The various
elements of the motive appear without essential alteration.</p>
<p>The play <i lang="es">El mejor amigo el muerto</i>, listed for
convenience as <i>Calderon</i>, has suffered, in contrast to
Lope&rsquo;s play, from many changes. Prince Robert of Ireland and Don
Juan de Castro are wrecked on the English coast. The former finds the
sea-captain Lidoro in a dying condition, and refuses to give him aid.
Don Juan, on the other hand, finds Lidoro&rsquo;s body, which a
creditor keeps from interment, and pays for his burial out of his
scanty savings from the wreck. He then goes to London, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>where
there is trouble because Queen Clarinda will not marry Prince Robert.
Don Juan is cast into prison on a false charge, his identity being
unknown to the queen, though he is recognized by Robert. He is saved by
the aid of Lidoro&rsquo;s ghost, nevertheless, lays siege for
Clarinda&rsquo;s hand, overcomes Robert, and so becomes king of
England.</p>
<p>The correspondence of names and details makes it clear that the
source of this play is <i>Lope de Vega</i>, though the plot has been
modified in several features. In the process of adaptation all trace of
<i>The Two Friends</i> has dropped out, a fact which would make the
position of the variant difficult to ascertain, had the authors not
left most of the characters their original names. The change in the
position of the rescue of the hero from prison, indeed, gives a
specious resemblance to the normal type <i>The Grateful Dead</i> +
<i>The Ransomed Woman</i>, which is quite unjustified by the real state
of the case.</p>
<p>All the other variants in which there is question of dividing a
child, save one,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4492src" href="#xd20e4492"
name="xd20e4492src">28</a> are folk-tales; and all of them save
three<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4497src" href="#xd20e4497" name=
"xd20e4497src">29</a> clearly belong in the category now under
discussion. If they did not group themselves in this way, I should be
unwilling even to consider the possibility of any general influence
from <i>The Two Friends</i> upon these tales, since the only trait
borrowed by any of them is precisely the division. Only in
<i>Oliver</i> and <i>Lope de Vega</i> is this sacrifice made for the
healing of a friend; and we have seen in the case of
<i>Transylvanian</i>, <i>Gaelic</i>, and <i>Breton III.</i> how
naturally the division of the child grows out of the division of the
wife. As the matter stands, however, the case for the influence of
<i>The Two Friends</i> is sufficiently strong to warrant the grouping
of these tales together. The general <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>relationship of the theme
may be deferred to a later chapter.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4532src"
href="#xd20e4532" name="xd20e4532src">30</a></p>
<p><i>Lithuanian II.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd20e4540src" href=
"#xd20e4540" name="xd20e4540src">31</a> is a characteristic specimen of
the class of tales just referred to. A prince, while travelling, sees a
corpse gnawed by swine in a street. He pays the man&rsquo;s creditors
for his release and has the body buried. Later, on the same journey, he
buys two maidens, one of whom is a king&rsquo;s daughter, and takes
them home. After a year he goes on a second journey with the
princess&rsquo;s picture for a figure-head on his ship, and a ring,
which she has given him. The picture is recognized by the
maiden&rsquo;s father, and the prince is sent back in the company of
certain nobles to fetch her. While they are returning to her home with
the princess, one of the nobles pushes the prince overboard. He lives
on an island for two years, until a man comes to him and promises to
bring him to court before the princess marries the traitor, on
condition of receiving his first-born son. The agreement is made, and
the prince wins his bride. After a son has been born to them, the man
appears and demands the child. He is put off for fifteen years, and at
the end of that time explains that he is the ghost of the rescued dead
man.</p>
<p>All the traits of the compound type, as it has already been
analyzed, are here apparent, save that the sacrifice of the child is
substituted for that of the wife. The variant does not demand any
further comment.</p>
<p>We come now to the various forms of <i>Jean de Calais</i>, which
make up a little group by themselves. The ten examples of the story
that I have been able to find differ from one another sufficiently to
make separate analyses of most of them necessary.</p>
<p>The version by Mme. de Gomez (<i>I.</i>) runs as follows:<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e4557src" href="#xd20e4557" name=
"xd20e4557src">32</a> Jean, the son of a rich merchant at Calais, while
on a journey, comes to the city of Palmanie on the island of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>Orimanie. There he pays the debts and secures the
burial of a corpse which is being devoured by dogs. He also ransoms two
slave girls, one of whom he marries and takes home. The woman is the
daughter of the King of Portugal. While taking her to her
father&rsquo;s court, Jean is separated from her by a treacherous
general, but is saved by the grateful dead, and enabled to rejoin his
wife. Later the ghost, who appears in the form of a man, demands half
of their son according to the agreement of division which they have
made. When Jean gives him the child to divide, the stranger praises his
loyalty and disappears.</p>
<p>This story has all the characteristics of the type <i>The Grateful
Dead</i> + <i>The Ransomed Woman</i> + the demand that the hero&rsquo;s
son be divided. In general outline it is scarcely distinguishable from
<i>Lithuanian II.</i>, save that the hero Jean is a merchant&rsquo;s
son instead of a prince. In details, however, it differs considerably.
For example, Jean marries one of the captive maidens as soon as he buys
her; there is no question of signs by which the hero is recognized by
his wife&rsquo;s father or by the princess herself; and the ghost is
less dilatory in his demands. Some of these differences are doubtless
to be accounted for through the unfaithfulness of the rendering, which
is semi-literary.</p>
<p>At all events, <i>Jean de Calais III., IV.</i>, and <i>V.</i>, all
three of which were heard on the Riviera, have several changes from
<i>I.</i>, though they vary from one another only in very minor
matters.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4585src" href="#xd20e4585" name=
"xd20e4585src">33</a> A single analysis will suffice for the three.
Jean de Calais, the son of a merchant, on his first voyage gives all
his profits to bury the corpse of a deceased debtor. On his second he
ransoms a beautiful woman (with or without a companion), <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>and
lives with her in poverty because of his father&rsquo;s displeasure. On
a subsequent voyage he bears her portrait on the prow of the ship,
where it is seen by her father. A former suitor meets him on his return
to court with his wife (in <i>III.</i> goes with him) and throws him
into the sea either by violence or by a ruse. He is cast up on an
island (in <i>III.</i> is carried thither in a boat by the ghost in
human form), whence he is conveyed by the ghost, on condition of
receiving half of his first son, or half of what he loves best, to the
court just as the princess is to marry the traitor. By a ruse he enters
the palace and is recognized. Later the ghost appears, but stays Jean
when he is about to sacrifice his son.</p>
<p><i>Jean de Calais VI.</i>, though from Brittany instead of southern
France, does not differ greatly from the above, nor from <i>I.</i> Jean
buries the dead man and ransoms two women on a single voyage, as in
<i>I.</i> He is kindly received at home in spite of his extravagance,
in which the variant differs from <i>III., IV.</i>, and <i>V.</i>, and
he marries one of the maidens there. On his next voyage the King of
Portugal (as in <i>I.</i> and <i>III.</i>) recognizes his
daughter&rsquo;s portrait and that of her maid, which the hero has
displayed on his ship. He brings his wife to the court, after which
they go back, together with a former suitor, for their possessions. On
the voyage Jean is thrown overboard, but is washed up on an island,
whither the ghost comes, announces himself immediately, and bargains
rescue for half of the hero&rsquo;s child. Jean is transported to court
miraculously, and there meets with the customary adventures at the
close of the tale.</p>
<p>The variant is chiefly peculiar, it will be remarked, in placing the
treachery of the former suitor after the marriage has been recognized
by the king, and in making the ghost announce himself at once. Jean
makes no blind bargain, a fact which detracts somewhat from the
interest. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Jean de Calais II.</i> and <i>VII.</i> differ from the other
forms of the story in several ways. In the former<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e4642src" href="#xd20e4642" name="xd20e4642src">34</a> Jean is the
son of a rich merchant, and has wasted much money. He is sent out to
seek his fortune on land with seven thousand pistoles, but he pays his
all for the debts and burial of a poor man. On his return, he is
commended by his father, but again falls into evil ways. Once more he
is sent forth with seven thousand pistoles, and passes the cemetery
where he buried the debtor. As he does so, a great white bird speaks
from the cross, saying that it is the soul of the dead man and will not
forget. Jean buys the two daughters of the King of Portugal from a
pirate and takes them home, where, with his complaisant father&rsquo;s
approval, he marries the elder. Later he journeys to Lisbon with the
portraits of the sisters, which are recognized by the king.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e4651src" href="#xd20e4651" name=
"xd20e4651src">35</a> He is sent back for his wife, but is pushed
overboard by a traitor, being driven on a rock in the sea, where he is
fed by the white bird. Meanwhile, the traitor goes to Calais and
remains there seven years as a suitor for the princess&rsquo;s hand. He
is about to be rewarded, when Jean, after promising half of what he
loves best to the white bird, is miraculously transported to Calais,
whither the King of Portugal comes at the same time. The white bird
bears witness to the hero&rsquo;s identity, and demands half of his
child. When Jean is about to divide the boy, however, it stops him and
flies away.</p>
<p>Version <i>VII.</i> has certain characteristics in common with the
above. It is a Basque tale. Juan de Kalais, the son of a widow, sets
off as a merchant, but sells his cargo and ship to pay the debts of a
corpse, which is being dragged about on a dung-heap. On his return, his
mother is angry. Again he goes on a voyage, but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>with
a very poor ship, and is compelled by an English captain to ransom a
beautiful maiden with all his cargo. The hero&rsquo;s mother is again
angry at this seemingly bad bargain, but she does not forbid his
marrying the girl. Juan is now sent to Portugal by his wife with a
portrait on a flag, a handkerchief, and a ring. At the same time she
tells him that she has been called Marie Madeleine. When the King of
Portugal sees the portrait, he sends the hero back with a general to
fetch Marie, who is his daughter. The general pitches Juan overboard
and goes for the princess, whom he persuades to marry him after seven
years. At the end of that time, a fox comes to Juan on an island, where
he has lived, and bargains to rescue him for half of all he has at
present and will have later. The hero arrives in Portugal, is
recognized by the king, tells his story, and has the general burned.
After a year the fox appears and demands payment, but, when Juan is
going to divide his child, it says that it is the soul of the dead man
whom he buried long before.</p>
<p>The two variants are chiefly peculiar in that they introduce a new
element into the compound,&mdash;<i>The Thankful Beast</i>. This
substitution of some beast for the ghost has been encountered twice
before<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4666src" href="#xd20e4666" name=
"xd20e4666src">36</a> in connection with <i>Jewish</i> and <i>Servian
IV.</i>, and must receive special treatment later on.<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e4675src" href="#xd20e4675" name="xd20e4675src">37</a> For the
present it is sufficient to remark the variation from all other forms
of <i>Jean de Calais</i> except <i>X.</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e4684src" href="#xd20e4684" name="xd20e4684src">38</a> In both
<i>II.</i> and <i>VII.</i> Jean makes two journeys,<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e4693src" href="#xd20e4693" name="xd20e4693src">39</a> as in
<i>III., IV.</i>, and <i>V.</i>, as against <i>I.</i> and <i>VI.</i>
The attitude of the parent differs widely in the two. The maiden whom
the hero marries is a Portuguese princess, which is the prevailing form
of the tale. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102"
name="pb102">102</a>]</span>portrait is also found in each, and both
state the time of Jean&rsquo;s exile as seven years. <i>II.</i> differs
from all the other versions in placing the later adventures of the
story at Calais rather than at the court of the heroine&rsquo;s father.
In <i>II.</i>, as in <i>VI.</i>, the ghost announces himself at the
first meeting, which is undoubtedly a modification of the original
story. Thus the two forms are sufficiently independent of one another,
in spite of their common use of an animal as the hero&rsquo;s
friend.</p>
<p><i>Jean de Calais VIII.</i>, though like <i>VI.</i> from a Breton
source, differs from all the other variants, chiefly in transposing the
burial and the ransom. Jean Carr&eacute;, sent out by his godmother as
a sea-captain, ransoms an English princess with her maid, and marries
the former. After two years, when a son has been born to them, Jean
goes on another voyage, and adorns the stern of his vessel with
portraits of his wife, the child, and the maid, which he is begged to
show while anchored at London. He does so, and is received by the king
as a son-in-law. One day he sees a poor debtor&rsquo;s body dragged
along the street, pays the debts, and has it buried. He then sets out
with a fleet to seek his wife, and is cast overboard by a Jew, who is
the pilot; but he is saved by a supernatural man, who carries him to a
green rock in the sea. The princess refuses to go to England when the
fleet arrives, and is wooed by the Jew so persistently that after two
years she promises him marriage. At this juncture Jean, who has been
asleep during the whole interval, is awakened by his rescuer and
carried over the sea, where the man explains that he is the ghost of
the debtor. Jean is first recognized by his little son, the Jew is
burned by the <i lang="fr">gendarmes</i>, and all ends well.</p>
<p>The transposition mentioned above is clearly a change due to the
individual narrator or some local predecessor, since everywhere else
the burial takes place before the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103"
href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>ransom. The mention of a Jew
as traitor is also peculiar and unreasonable, since no motive for his
action appears until later, and then incongruously. The variant is
likewise defective in not having any bargain between the ghost and the
hero. In other respects it is normal save in minor details. As in
<i>V.</i>, the heroine is made an English princess, which occurs
nowhere else. On the whole the version is picturesque, but
defective.</p>
<p><i>Jean de Calais IX.</i> is unique in certain features, though in
most respects normal. It is from Asturia in Spain. Juan de Calais goes
out into the world to seek his fortune with a single peseta as his
store. This he gives to bury a corpse, and proceeds. In a certain
kingdom he attracts the notice of a princess, who marries him after
considerable opposition. When the wedding is over, he takes his wife to
seek his father&rsquo;s blessing, but is cast off the ship by a former
suitor of the lady, her cousin. He is carried to an island by invisible
hands, where he lives until a phantom bargains to take him to court for
half of what he gets by his marriage. He arrives on the day of the
princess&rsquo;s wedding. He is recognized by the king, who puts to his
guests a parable of an old key found just when a new one has been made,
while the suitor flees. On the following night, when Juan is dejected
at the thought of giving up half his son, the phantom appears and
releases him from his agreement, explaining its identity.</p>
<p>Juan wins the gratitude of the dead man, and obtains his bride in
this version on a single journey, as in <i>I.</i> and <i>VI.</i>, but
its chief peculiarity is the manner in which he gets his wife, with the
sequel that the couple set out to seek his father instead of hers. The
ransom is replaced by a romantic but more natural wooing, while the
ghost appears somewhat unusually <i lang="la">in propria persona</i>.
One of the oddest traits in the whole version is the parable of the
key, by which the king introduces the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb104" href="#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>hero to the assembled
guests. This will be encountered again in <i>Breton VII.</i></p>
<p>In <i>Jean de Calais X.</i>, finally, a <span class="corr" id=
"xd20e4765" title="Source: Wallon">Walloon</span> variant, appear
certain interesting changes in the fabric. The King of Calais sent his
son Jean to America to trade, but the prince was shipwrecked on the
coast of Portugal, and there ransomed and rescued a corpse, which was
being dragged through the streets because the man had died in debt. The
king scolded his son for wasting so much money, but the next year sent
him to Portugal to trade. There he encountered brigands, who had
captured the king&rsquo;s daughter with her maid, and ransomed them. On
returning to Calais with his bride, he was ill received, and resolved
to go back to Portugal. A young lord of Calais accompanied them and
threw Jean into the sea, while he took the princess onward and obtained
from her a promise of marriage in a year. Happily Jean found a plank by
which he reached an island, where a crow fed him every day. At the end
of a year he promised the crow half his blood for rescue, and was taken
to Portugal by a flock of crows. There he was recognized, and the
traitor hanged. One day the crow appeared and demanded the fulfilment
of the promise. Jean was about to slay his son, when the bird explained
its identity with the ghost of the dead man.</p>
<p>This is the only version which makes Jean a prince; and it is
curious that the change should occur in a tale from a region not very
remote from Calais. Most of the events of the tale take place in
Portugal, however, which is an extension of the ordinary appearance of
that country as the home of the heroine. The most striking peculiarity
of the version is the home of the traitor, who is a lord of Calais
instead of Portugal. All mention of signs is lacking, which is
doubtless due to the changes just mentioned. In the matter of the
appearance of the ghost as an animal the variant allies itself with
<i>II.</i> and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span><i>VII.</i>, though it has no special likeness
to them in other respects.</p>
<p><i>Basque II.</i> is like <i>Gaelic</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e4784src" href="#xd20e4784" name="xd20e4784src">40</a> in general
outline. Juan Dekos is sent out with a ship to complete his education.
He pays all that he gets for his cargo to ransom and bury the corpse of
a debtor. His father is not pleased, but sends him out again. This time
he uses all his money to ransom eight slaves, seven of whom he sends to
their homes, but carries one home with him. His father is still more
angry, and casts him off; but Juan has a portrait of Marie Louise
painted for the figure-head of his ship, and sets off with her for her
own land. The lame mate pitches him overboard, and carries the lady to
her father&rsquo;s dwelling-place, where he is to marry her after a
year and a day. Juan is saved by an angel and placed on a rock. On
Marie&rsquo;s wedding-day the angel returns, and offers to take the
hero to his bride for half of the child that will be born. The angel
was the soul of the dead man. So Juan arrives in time, is recognized by
a handkerchief, and tells his story, which causes the burning of the
mate. After a year the angel comes for his half of the babe, but when
Juan starts to divide it stays his hand.</p>
<p>Webster, the collector of this tale, noticed<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e4789src" href="#xd20e4789" name="xd20e4789src">41</a> its
similarity to <i>Gaelic</i>, especially in the name of the hero, and
surmised that the Basques must have borrowed it from the Celts in some
way. The theory is tenable, though a comparison of the two variants
shows that the Basques must either have borrowed it in a form
considerably different from the Highland tale as we have it, or have
altered the details largely. The first part of the story is entirely
different; the hero goes on two voyages in <i>Basque II.</i>, one only
in <i>Gaelic</i>; the lady goes with the hero immediately in the
former, he returns for her in the latter; the treachery and the signs
are different; the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106"
name="pb106">106</a>]</span>ghost appears as an angel instead of a
human being in <i>Basque</i>; and the promised division concerns the
wife and three sons in <i>Gaelic</i>, a single babe in <i>Basque</i>.
Thus, apart from the title, there is little to substantiate
Webster&rsquo;s theory. The differences are certainly more important
than those between any two versions of <i>Jean de Calais</i>. In some
particulars, like the voyages and the portrait on the ship,
<i>Basque</i> is more nearly normal, while in others, like the account
of the treachery and the appearance of the ghost, <i>Gaelic</i>
conforms to the ordinary form. Certainly <i>Basque II.</i> is to be
regarded as a fairly close relative of <i>Lithuanian II.</i> and
<i>Jean de Calais</i>.</p>
<p>In <i>Breton VII.</i> a normal form appears, though with some
embroidery of details. A merchant&rsquo;s son, Iouenn Kerm&eacute;nou,
goes out with his father&rsquo;s ship to trade. He pays the greater
part of the proceeds of the cargo to ransom and bury the corpse of a
debtor, which dogs are devouring. On his way home he gives the rest of
his money to ransom a princess, who is being carried to a ravaging
serpent, which has to be fed with a royal princess every seven years.
He is cast off by his father when he reaches home, but is supported by
an aunt and enabled to marry his lady. After a son has been born to
them, he is sent out by an uncle on another ship, which by his
wife&rsquo;s counsel has the figure of himself and herself with their
child carved on the prow. He comes to her father&rsquo;s realm, and
after some misunderstanding is sent back with two ministers of state
for the princess. While returning with her, he is pushed overboard by
the first minister, who is an old suitor for the lady&rsquo;s hand, but
swims ashore on a desert island. The wife goes to court, and after
three years consents to marry the minister. All this time Iouenn lives
alone on his rock, but at the end is greeted by the ghost of the man
whose body he buried, which appears in a very <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>horrible form. On condition of giving in a year
and a day half of what he and his wife possess, he is taken to court by
this being, where he is recognized by means of a gold chain, which the
princess had given him. At the wedding feast, which takes place that
day, the wife recounts a parable of how she has found the old key of a
coffer just as a new one was ready, brings in Iouenn, and has the
minister burned. At the end of a year and a day comes the ghost, and
demands half of the child (the older one has died) that has been born
to them. As the hero reluctantly proceeds to divide the child, the
ghost stops him, praises his fidelity, and disappears.</p>
<p>It will be seen that this variant does not differ in essentials from
those previously summarized, though its details exactly coincide with
none of them. The order of events is normal, very like that of
<i>Lithuanian II.</i>, for example, yet it has marks of peculiarity.
Chief among these are the events connected with the ransom of the lady
and the parable by which she introduces her long lost husband to court.
The first is a trait borrowed from the <i>Perseus and Andromeda</i>
motive,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4847src" href="#xd20e4847" name=
"xd20e4847src">42</a> the second is the same as the riddle in <i>Jean
de Calais IX.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd20e4855src" href="#xd20e4855"
name="xd20e4855src">43</a> How this latter feature should happen to
appear in these two widely separated variants and nowhere else I am not
wise enough to explain.</p>
<p><i>Simrock I.</i> introduces still another complication in the way
of compounds. A merchant&rsquo;s son on a journey secures proper burial
for a black Turkish slave, thereby using all his money. His father is
angry with him on his return. On his second voyage he ransoms a maiden
and is cast off by his father when he reaches home. The young couple
live for a time on the proceeds from the sale of the wife&rsquo;s
handiwork, but after a little set off to the court of her father, who
is a king. On the way <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href=
"#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>they meet one of the king&rsquo;s
ships, and go aboard. The hero is cast into the sea by the captain, but
is saved by a black fellow and brought back to the ship. Again he is
cast overboard. When the princess arrives at home, she agrees to marry
whoever can paint three rooms to her liking. The hero, meanwhile, is
again saved by the black man, and in return for the promise of his
first child on its twelfth birthday he is given the power of obtaining
his wishes. After a year and a day he is taken to court by his friend,
where by wishing he paints the three rooms, the third with the story of
his life. So he is recognized. On the twelfth birthday of his first
child the black man comes to him and is offered the boy, but instead of
taking him explains his identity.</p>
<p>As far as <i>The Grateful Dead, The Ransomed Woman</i>, and the
sacrifice of the child are concerned, this follows the normal course of
events, except perhaps as to the child, of actually dividing which
there is no question. Like <i>Lithuanian II., Jean de Calais III., IV.,
V.</i>, and <i>X.</i>, <i>Basque II.</i>, and <i>Norwegian I.</i>, it
makes the hero and heroine set out for her father&rsquo;s court
together and of their own free will.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e4882src" href="#xd20e4882" name="xd20e4882src">44</a> The colour
of the thankful dead is a peculiar trait. Yet the element which
complicates the question, as mentioned above, is the feat by which the
hero obtains his wife. If I am not mistaken, this allies the variant on
one side with stories of the type of <i>The Water of Life</i>, where
the bride is gained by the performance of some task obviously set as
impossible. The questions involving the relations of such motives with
<i>The Grateful Dead</i> will occupy the next chapter, so that it needs
simply to be mentioned at this point.</p>
<p>In <i>Simrock II.</i> a miller&rsquo;s son goes with merchandise to
England. In London he pays all his money for the debts and the burial
of a poor man. He is again sent to England by his father, and this time
he gives his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>whole ship to ransom a beautiful maiden. When he
returns with her, he is cast off by his father, marries the girl, and
lives on what she makes by her needle. He takes a piece of her
embroidery with him to England, where it is seen by the king and queen,
whose daughter has become his wife. He is sent for her in company with
a minister, who pitches him overboard and goes on for the princess,
hoping to marry her. The hero swims ashore, in the meantime, and
communicates with his wife by means of a dove, which also feeds him.
Finally a spirit conveys him to London, after receiving the promise of
half of his first child. He obtains work in the kitchen of the castle,
and sends a ring to his wife, by means of which they are reunited. At
the birth of their child he refuses to give the spirit half, but offers
the whole instead,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4901src" href=
"#xd20e4901" name="xd20e4901src">45</a> whereupon ensues an
explanation.</p>
<p>This variant is of the same type as <i>Jean de Calais II.</i> and
<i>VII.</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4921src" href="#xd20e4921"
name="xd20e4921src">46</a> resembling the latter more than the former
in details. The three are sufficiently unlike, however, to make any
immediate relationship quite out of the question, even did not
geography forbid. As in <i>Hungarian II., Oliver, Lope de Vega,
Calderon, Jean de Calais V.</i> and <i>VIII.</i>, and <i>Norwegian
I.</i>, the heroine is an English princess, a point of interest, but
not of much importance.</p>
<p><i>Simrock VIII.</i> differs from the above in only two points. The
beginning states that a merchant while in Turkey pays the debts and
burial expenses of a poor man. On his next voyage he buys three hundred
slaves from the Emperor of Constantinople. Three of them he keeps at
his home, one of whom he marries. The further adventures of the hero
agree with <i>Simrock II.</i> even in names and most details, except
that the hero is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110"
name="pb110">110</a>]</span>recognized at the court by dropping his
ring in a cup of tea, which the princess gives him to drink. It will be
evident that the two tales are nearly related.</p>
<p>Last, but not least interesting of the versions in which the child
appears, is the <i>Factor&rsquo;s Garland</i> or <i>Turkey Factor</i>,
which must have been almost as well known in England at one time as the
form of the story in <i>Jack the Giant-Killer</i>. It has no very
remarkable features in its outline. A young Englishman, while acting as
a factor in Turkey, pays fifty pounds to have the body of a Christian
buried. A little later he pays one hundred pounds to ransom a beautiful
Christian slave, and takes her back to his home, where he makes her his
house-keeper. Later he sets out again, and is told by the woman to wear
a silk waistcoat that she has embroidered, when he comes to the court
whither he is bound. The work is recognized by her father, the emperor,
and the factor sent back to fetch her. While returning with the
princess, he is pushed overboard in his sleep by the captain, but swims
to an island, whence he is rescued by an old man in a canoe, who
bargains with him for his first-born son when three (or thirty) months
old. The hero is recognized at court and marries the princess, while
the captain dies by suicide. In two (or three) years the old man
returns, just when the couple&rsquo;s son is three (or thirty) months
old, and demands the child. On the hero&rsquo;s yielding, he explains
that he is the ghost, and disappears.</p>
<p>Like <i>Gaelic</i><a class="noteref" id="xd20e4959src" href=
"#xd20e4959" name="xd20e4959src">47</a> and <i>Simrock
VIII.</i>&mdash;the latter just discussed&mdash;this version makes the
hero undergo his early adventures in Turkey. Indeed, the similarity to
<i>Gaelic</i> throughout is very notable, far more so than in the case
of <i>Basque II.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd20e4970src" href=
"#xd20e4970" name="xd20e4970src">48</a> The only point in which it
differs materially is the division of property, which in <i>Gaelic</i>
concerns the wife and the three children, in the <i>Factor&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>Garland</i> one son only. In this matter there
is agreement between the present variant, <i>Basque II.</i>, and
<i>Simrock VIII.</i> Despite the likeness to <i>Gaelic</i>, there is no
good reason for arguing any immediate connection with that version.
They stand close to one another geographically and in content, that is
all; they cannot be proved to be more than near relatives in the same
generation.</p>
<p>The variants which introduce the division of the child have now all
been considered. It is necessary to turn to a few scattered specimens
in which the compound, <i>The Grateful Dead</i> + <i>The Ransomed
Woman</i>, has been joined with other material.</p>
<p><i>Bohemian</i> is a curious and instructive example of the
confusion which has resulted from welding various themes together.
Bolemir, a merchant&rsquo;s son, is sent to sea, where he is robbed by
pirates and imprisoned. He finds means to help an old man, who gives
him a magic flute, and a princess, who gives him half of her veil and
ring. By the aid of the flute he succeeds in winning the chief&rsquo;s
permission to leave the island in the company of his friends. He sails
with them to another island. There, at the old man&rsquo;s request, he
strikes him on the head and buries him. He then goes home with the
princess. On his second voyage he displays from his mast-head a golden
standard, which the princess has made. He reaches the city of the
lady&rsquo;s father, tells his story, and returns for the princess with
the chamberlain. While they are all returning together, he is cast into
the sea by the chamberlain, who takes the woman to court and obtains a
promise of marriage, when a church has been built to her mind. Bolemir
is saved from the sea by the ghost of the old man, and is given a
wishing ring. He turns himself into an eagle and flies to court, into
an old man and becomes a watchman at the church. By means of his ring
he builds the structure, and paints it with the story of his life. At
the wedding breakfast <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href=
"#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span>of the princess, who cannot longer
delay the bridal, he tells his story, and so marries her.</p>
<p>The peculiar form of the burial in this variant will be at once
evident, though the reason for it is not clear to me. Disenchantment by
decapitation is a common phenomenon in folk-lore and romance;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e5007src" href="#xd20e5007" name=
"xd20e5007src">49</a> but though the blow on the head, which the hero
gives the old man in our tale, surely stands for beheading, it is hard
to see where any unspelling process comes in. It is perhaps best to
suppose the trait a confused borrowing, without much meaning as it
stands. The ransoming of the woman is closely connected with the
benefits done the old man. That it occurs on the same journey has been
shown by the variations in <i>Jean de Calais</i> to be a matter of
little consequence. With respect to the standard and the ring, by which
the hero restores his wife to her father, and later to himself, the
tale is perfectly in accord with the prevalent form of the compound
type; and so also in regard to the rescue of the hero by the ghost. No
hint is given of any agreement of division between the hero and the
ghost. The chief peculiarity of the variant, however, is the means by
which the heroine is won. The feat recalls <i>Simrock I.</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e5019src" href="#xd20e5019" name=
"xd20e5019src">50</a> even in details like the demand on the part of
the bride for mural decoration. It again shows the combination of the
present type with a theme akin to <i>The Water of Life</i>.</p>
<p><i>Simrock III.</i> has several points of contact with the above.
Karl, the son of an English merchant, on his first voyage to Italy pays
the debts of a merchant who has died bankrupt. On his way home he buys
two sisters from some pirates at an inn. His father casts him off, so
he marries the older of the maidens, who tells him that she is a
princess. They start for Italy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113"
href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>together, and on the way meet
an Italian prince, who is a suitor for the wife&rsquo;s hand. The hero
is cast overboard, but is brought to land by a great bird, which tells
him that it is the ghost of the man whom he has buried. It directs him
to go to court and give himself out as a painter. The bird again comes
to him there with a dagger in its beak, and tells him to cut off its
head. Unwillingly Karl obeys, and sees before him the spirit of the
dead man. The ghost paints the room in which they are standing with the
hero&rsquo;s history. So on the wedding-day of the princess with the
traitor, Karl explains the meaning of the pictures and wins his bride
again.</p>
<p>This Swabian story has preserved the decapitation<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e5033src" href="#xd20e5033" name="xd20e5033src">51</a> in much
better form than <i>Bohemian</i>, though the reason for its
introduction is still hard to understand. The ghost is obviously
released from some spell when it is beheaded, and is thus enabled to
help the hero to better advantage than before. The episode also occurs
in a more logical position than in <i>Bohemian</i>. It replaces the
more ordinary and normal test of the hero by the ghost. Probably the
introduction of it in the two cases is sporadic, though some connection
between the two is conceivable. As far as <i>The Grateful Dead</i> and
<i>The Ransomed Woman</i> proper are concerned, the variant has no
peculiarities of special importance, being of the type in which the
hero and heroine set out for court together.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e5049src" href="#xd20e5049" name="xd20e5049src">52</a> It
contains, however, the feat by which the bride is won, in the same form
as in <i>Simrock I.</i> and <i>Bohemian</i>, which is due to an
alliance with the type of <i>The Water of Life</i>. Yet it differs from
them in making the ghost appear first as a bird, which connects it with
<i>Jean de Calais II., VII.</i>, and <i>X.</i>, and with <i>Simrock
II.</i> and <i>VIII.</i>, variants that have the thankful beast playing
the r&ocirc;le of ghost.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5074src" href=
"#xd20e5074" name="xd20e5074src">53</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb114" href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Simrock VII.</i>, together with some other peculiarities, again
has the feat of winning the bride, though it is a feat of another sort.
Wilhelm catches a swan-maiden, and later releases her from an enchanted
mountain by hewing trees, separating grain, and finding his wife among
three hundred women. Thus by her help he breaks the spell, and carries
her back home. Later they journey together to her father&rsquo;s court.
On the way Wilhelm pays the debts of a corpse, and has it buried. They
meet two officers of the king, who toss Wilhelm overboard from the ship
in which they sail, but he is saved by the ghost of the dead man and
brought to court. He is recognized by the princess, and proves his
identity to her father by means of a ring and a handkerchief.</p>
<p>The most salient point here is the fact that the maiden is not
ransomed at all, but instead is captured like any other swan-maiden. We
have already met with the theme of <i>The Swan-Maiden</i> in
combination with <i>The Grateful Dead</i> in simple form;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e5090src" href="#xd20e5090" name=
"xd20e5090src">54</a> but <i>Servian V.</i> has evidently nothing to do
with <i>Simrock VII.</i>, since the part played by the borrowed motive
is different in each. In the former it is introduced as the reward
bestowed on the hero by the ghost, while in the latter the swan-maiden
simply replaces the ransomed maiden, as is shown by the subsequent
events of the story, which follow the normal order as far as she is
concerned. The feats by which the hero disenchants her are essentially
like those in <i>Bohemian, Simrock I.</i>, and <i>Simrock III.</i>,
though they are differently placed. Probably the introduction of this
new material accounts for the transposition of the ransoming and the
burial, as the latter is in other respects regular. It is curious to
observe that the process of changing about various features, thus
begun, continued in other ways, as in the matter of the signs by which
the hero is recognized by his father-in-law and his wife. These
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>things go to show, however, that back of the
variant must have existed the compound type in a normal form.</p>
<p>In <i>Simrock V.</i> the thankful beast again appears, but in a less
complicated setting than in the case of <i>Jean de Calais II.,
VII.</i>, and <i>X.</i>, or <i>Simrock II., III.</i>, and <i>VIII.</i>
A widow&rsquo;s son on his way home from market pays the debts of a
corpse and buries it, thus using all his money. The next time he goes
to market, he gives all his proceeds to ransom a maiden, whom he
marries. She does embroidery to gain money, and one day holds out a
piece of it to the king, who is passing. He recognizes her as his
daughter, and accepts the hero as son-in-law. The young couple start
back home for the widow, but on the way the servants cast the young man
into the sea. He escapes, however, to an island, where he is fed by an
eagle. Later the eagle declares itself to be the ghost of the dead man,
and brings its benefactor to court.</p>
<p><i>Oldenburgian</i> is a similar tale. A merchant&rsquo;s son while
on a voyage pays thirty dollars to bury a man, and also buys a captive
princess with her maid. Though ill-received by his father on his
return, he marries the girl. Later he goes on another voyage, with his
wife&rsquo;s portrait as the figure-head of his ship. This is
recognized by the king, who sends him back for the princess in the
company of a minister. The latter pitches him overboard, goes on for
the princess, and does not tell her of her loss till they arrive at
court. She finally consents to marry the traitor after five years.
Meanwhile, the hero lives on an island, whither on the day appointed
for the princess&rsquo;s bridal comes the ghost of the dead in the form
of a snow-white dove. It takes him to the court, where he is recognized
by a ring, a gift from his bride, which he drops into a cup that she
offers him.</p>
<p>Of these two variants, <i>Oldenburgian</i> is much better preserved
than the Tyrolese story (<i>Simrock V.</i>). The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>latter is dressed in a homely fashion, which
probably accounts for some of the changes, since the gap between the
visits to market and the romantic or miraculous features of the
couple&rsquo;s later adventures was too wide to be easily bridged. The
disappointed suitor is not mentioned, which leaves the attempt on the
hero&rsquo;s life without motivation, and clearly indicates some
loss.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5139src" href="#xd20e5139" name=
"xd20e5139src">55</a> The trait is distinctly marked in
<i>Oldenburgian</i>, as are all the other events connected with <i>The
Ransomed Woman</i>, though <i>Simrock V.</i> provides an entirely
original reason for the voyage of the young couple,&mdash;their wish to
get the hero&rsquo;s mother. The features concerning the rescue by the
ghost and the hero&rsquo;s return to court are better preserved again
in <i>Oldenburgian</i>, though both lack the agreement to divide, which
is probably obscured as elsewhere by the prominence given the rescued
woman. The most striking similarity between the two, however, lies in
the fact that the ghost first appears as a bird. This clearly shows the
existence of a type of <i>The Grateful Dead</i> + <i>The Ransomed
Woman</i>, on which <i>The Thankful Beasts</i> has had some
influence.</p>
<p>It remains to consider the general relations of the variants
discussed in this chapter. The wide variety in detail of the incidents
concerned with the history of the hero&rsquo;s wife, yet the essential
uniformity which they show, would indicate clearly, for one thing, that
<i>The Ransomed Woman</i> is a motive originally quite independent of
<i>The Grateful Dead</i>,&mdash;that the type of story which is our
present concern is a true compound. It would even be possible to
reconstruct the independent theme in a form not unlike the Wendish
folk-tale cited in the beginning of the chapter. The hero, while on a
journey, ransoms a princess, takes her home, goes on another journey
with some sign that attracts her father&rsquo;s notice, goes back to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>her and is cast into the sea by some man who
hopes to marry her himself, is rescued, and returns to court to claim
his bride, usually by means of a token.</p>
<p>The points of contact between this motive and <i>The Grateful
Dead</i> would seem to be, first, the journey which the hero undertakes
at the opening of the plot. It will be noted that in the compound he
usually makes two voyages, burying the dead on the first and ransoming
the maiden on the second, though the two are sometimes welded. The
second point of contact, I take it, was the rescue of the hero. In each
story he did a good act for which he was rewarded in some way. It has
been shown that this reward sometimes took the form of a rescue in the
simple form of <i>The Grateful Dead</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e5187src" href="#xd20e5187" name="xd20e5187src">56</a> and in the
compound with <i>The Poison Maiden</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e5196src" href="#xd20e5196" name="xd20e5196src">57</a> What more
natural than that it should lead to another combination with a story
where the hero was saved from death? The difference in the case of the
latter, of course, would be that the agency of rescue was of little
importance. Could <i>Simonides</i> be shown to have anything more than
a literary life in mediaeval Europe, I should be inclined to think that
the rescue in that tale, even though the tale itself is not necessarily
connected with <i>The Grateful Dead</i> as we know the theme, might
have had some influence on the union. As the matter stands, however, it
is probably better to believe that the two motives were united in
eastern Europe, the one being Oriental and the other of uncertain
derivation. That each motive had a wife as part of the hero&rsquo;s
reward must be taken for granted, and it must have helped to combine
them.</p>
<p>It follows from this that the compound <i>The Grateful Dead</i> +
<i>The Ransomed Woman</i> is quite independent of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>the
one discussed in the previous chapter, and could not have proceeded
from it as Hippe thought.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5216src" href=
"#xd20e5216" name="xd20e5216src">58</a> It would have been next to
impossible for that combined type to divest itself of the features
peculiar to <i>The Poison Maiden</i>, and to absorb in their place
those of <i>The Ransomed Woman</i> without leaving some trace of the
process. Thus the existence of the compound as an independent growth is
assured. In this connection it is interesting to note that the rescue
of the hero from drowning in consequence of an act of treachery (or
from an island) occurs in all the variants of the type save four,
<i>Transylvanian, Trancoso</i>, <i>Gasconian</i>, and <i>Straparola
I.</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5235src" href="#xd20e5235" name=
"xd20e5235src">59</a> but in no other version of <i>The Grateful
Dead</i> as far as I know.</p>
<p>From this general type developed minor varieties with traits
borrowed from <i>The Water of Life, The Thankful Beasts</i>, and <i>The
Two Friends</i>, or some such tale. Thus very complex variants arose.
The question of the connection which these subsidiary elements sustain
to the central theme cannot properly be discussed until they have been
seen in other combinations. The part they play in the development of
the story, it is evident, must have been a secondary one both in
importance and in time. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href=

<p class="first">The <i lang="de">m&auml;rchen</i> known in its various
forms as <i>The Water of Life</i><a class="noteref" id="xd20e5270src"
href="#xd20e5270" name="xd20e5270src">1</a> is based on the myth which
goes by the same name.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5285src" href=
"#xd20e5285" name="xd20e5285src">2</a> The myth, as has been shown
quite independently by two recent investigators, Dr.
W&uuml;nsche<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5288src" href="#xd20e5288"
name="xd20e5288src">3</a> and Dr. E. W. Hopkins,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e5291src" href="#xd20e5291" name="xd20e5291src">4</a> is of
Semitic origin, and is found among the traditions of the
Assyrio-Babylonian cycle. It is to be distinguished from the very
similar myth of <i>The Fountain of Youth</i>, which apparently
originated in India.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5301src" href=
"#xd20e5301" name="xd20e5301src">5</a> The latter concerns the magic
properties of the &ldquo;water of rejuvenation&rdquo;; the former in
its uncontaminated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120"
name="pb120">120</a>]</span>form, at least, deals with water which
cures, revivifies, or revitalizes. The two have been frequently
confused, not only in popular tradition of all ages, but in critical
writings of contemporary date as well. It is the great merit of
Professor Hopkins&rsquo; article, to which reference has been made,
that their essential difference in origin and character is clearly
marked. Though he makes no pretence that his study of <i>The Fountain
of Youth</i> is definitive, he has broken ground which sadly needed the
plough, and incidentally has thrown light upon <i>The Water of
Life</i>.</p>
<p>The myth which is properly known by this name is intimately
connected in origin and development with that of <i>The Tree of
Life</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5317src" href="#xd20e5317" name=
"xd20e5317src">6</a> which finds expression in the legends of the
Cross. In the words of Dr. W&uuml;nsche:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e5323src" href="#xd20e5323" name="xd20e5323src">7</a>
&ldquo;<span lang="de">Wie wir aus den kosmogonischen und theogonischen
Mythen und Sagen der V&ouml;lker das Rauschen des Lebensbaumes
vernehmen, durch dessen Fr&uuml;chte sich G&ouml;tter und Menschen ihre
ungeschw&auml;chte Lebenskraft und ewige Jugendfrische erhalten, so
nicht minder das Sprudeln einer Quelle des Lebenswassers, die Leben
schafft und zu Ende gehendes oder bereits erloschenes Leben wieder zu
neuem Sein erweckt.</span>&rdquo; Both myths are Semitic, and both have
profoundly influenced Christian doctrine. It is with the &ldquo;water
of life,&rdquo; however, that we are immediately concerned, and with
that only as it has found embodiment in a widely disseminated and
variously modified tale. Whence this <i lang="de">m&auml;rchen</i> came
we must presently inquire, in order to reach some conclusion as to the
point in space and time where it joined <i>The Grateful Dead</i>, but
we must first fix its essential traits.</p>
<p>Owing to the complex variations which the tale <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>presents in its various combinations with really
foreign themes, there is great difficulty in getting at the outline of
the original story or even the characteristics common to all the known
variants. To do this satisfactorily would require a searching and
detailed study, which it is impossible to undertake here,&mdash;an
examination with <i>The Water of Life</i> as the point of attack. It is
possible, however, to arrive at a rough sketch of the theme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span lang="fr">Dans tous ces contes,</span>&rdquo; says
Cosquin, in his notes on <i>The Water of Life</i>,<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e5351src" href="#xd20e5351" name="xd20e5351src">8</a>
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">trois princes vont chercher pour leur
p&egrave;re l&rsquo;eau de la vie ou un fruit merveilleux qui doit le
gu&eacute;rir, et c&rsquo;est le plus jeune qui r&eacute;ussit dans

<p>Dr. W&uuml;nsche&rsquo;s summary is somewhat different:<a class=

&ldquo;<span lang="de">Gew&ouml;hnlich handelt es sich um einen
K&ouml;nig und seine drei S&ouml;hne. Der K&ouml;nig leidet an einer
schlimmen Krankheit, von der ihn kein Arzt zu heilen vermag. Da wird
ihm durch irgendeine Gelegenheit die Kunde, dass er von seinem Siechtum
durch das Lebenswasser eines fernen Landes befreit werden k&ouml;nne.
Aus Liebe zu ihrem Vater machen sich die drei S&ouml;hne nacheinander
auf den Weg, das Lebenswasser zu holen. Doch die beiden &auml;ltesten
erliegen den auf dem Wege ihnen begegnenden Versuchungen, nur der
j&uuml;ngste ist wegen seiner Standhaftigkeit und Bescheidenheit so
gl&uuml;cklich, es zu erhalten. Ein Riese, ein Zwerg, ein alter Mann
oder ein alte Frau <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122"
name="pb122">122</a>]</span>sind ihm zur Auffindung der Wunderquelle
behilflich, indem sie ihm guten Rat erteilen und ihm sagen, wie er es
anzufangen und wovor er sich in acht zu nehmen habe. Hier und da
greifen auch dienstbare Tiere, Vierf&uuml;ssler, V&ouml;gel und Fische
hilfreich ein, indem sie dem J&uuml;nglinge genau die &Ouml;rtlichkeit
des Wassers angeben, oder auch selbst ihn mit Schnelligkeit dahin
bringen. Die Lebensquelle sprudelt in einem Berge, der sich nur zu
gewissen Zeiten, gew&ouml;hnlich gegen Mittag oder Mitternacht von
11&ndash;12 Uhr &ouml;ffnet. Im berge steht in der Regel in einem
pr&auml;chtigen Garten ein versunkenes Schloss, das die grossen
Sch&auml;tze und Kostbarkeiten birgt, durch deren Anblick der
Eintretende geblendet wird. In einem Gemache des Schlosses wieder ruht
auf einem Bett eine Jungfrau von wunderbarer Sch&ouml;nheit, die
sp&auml;ter als Prinzessin hervortritt und den Prinzen, der durch das
Sch&ouml;pfen des Lebenswassers sie von ihrem Zauber gel&ouml;st hat,
zum Gemahle heischt. Der Prinz hat nur kurze Zeit bei ihr geruht oder
ihr einen fl&uuml;chtigen Kuss auf die Lippen gedr&uuml;ckt. In vielen
F&auml;llen wird der Eingang zur Quelle von einem Drachen oder einem

Br&uuml;dern wieder zusammen, die ihr Leben durch tolle Streiche
verwirkt haben und die er vom Tode loskauft. Zuweilen sind aber die
Br&uuml;der durch ihre Unbedachtsamkeit in schwarze Steine verwandelt
worden und liegen am Abhange des Zauberberges, oder stehen als
Marmors&auml;ulen auf demselben, oder sind infolge ihres Hochmutes in
einen tiefen Abgrund eingeschlossen. Auch in diesem Zustande werden sie
durch den j&uuml;ngsten Bruder bald durch das gesch&ouml;pfte Wasser
des Lebens, bald auf seine Bitten hin wieder ins Leben gerufen. Vereint

nach der Ankunft des Bruders, dessen vertauschtes Wasser den K&ouml;nig
nur noch elender gemacht hat. Dabei raunen sie dem K&ouml;nige heimlich
ins Ohr, dass der j&uuml;ngere Bruder ihn habe vergiften wollen,
infolgedessen dieser vom K&ouml;nige verbannt oder gar zum Tode
verurteilt wird. Derselbe lebt nun l&auml;ngere Zeit zur&uuml;ckgezogen
in einer untergeordneten Stellung, bis endlich durch die von ihm

kommt.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. W&uuml;nsche gives as subsidiary types stories where a princess
wishes the magic water for herself, and, when her two brothers fail to
return with it, goes on a quest which results in obtaining the water
and releasing the enchanted brothers; where a mother and son are the
chief actors; where a bird, or fruit, or the water of death is
substituted for the water of life; and where thankful beasts appear.
All of these elements and more appear in the accessible variants, yet
not all of them can be said rightly to represent <i>The Water of
Life</i> as such. The basal traits of the story are much more simple
than Dr. W&uuml;nsche would have us believe. They do not include, for
example, the wonderful companions whom the hero finds nor the
adventures with the enchanted princess, since these are in reality
traits of originally separate themes, as will presently be
shown.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5376src" href="#xd20e5376" name=
"xd20e5376src">10</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, Cosquin&rsquo;s outline seems to me defective in
two ways. First, he does not recognize that there existed in the
original theme some reward due the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124"
href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>hero for his constancy and
intelligence in the pursuit of his quest. <i>A priori</i> this
conclusion would be expected from the general manner of folk-tales, and
as a matter of fact it appears in all the versions which have come to
my attention. The reward almost always takes the form of a princess,
though the manner in which she is won varies very greatly. In the
second place, Cosquin seems to regard <i>The Golden Bird</i> as a theme
quite independent of <i>The Water of Life</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e5392src" href="#xd20e5392" name="xd20e5392src">11</a> This, I
think, is to lose sight of the essential likeness between the two
tales, despite their difference of introduction. As Dr. W&uuml;nsche
notes,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5399src" href="#xd20e5399" name=
"xd20e5399src">12</a> not only a bird, but a fruit or the water of
death may be substituted for the usual object of the quest. Indeed,
certain variants have more than one of these magical forces.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e5402src" href="#xd20e5402" name=
"xd20e5402src">13</a> To be sure, this superfluity of riches doubtless
results from the fusion of subsidiary types, but none the less it
points to the original unity of the central theme, which is all that I
wish to suggest.</p>
<p>From this discussion we emerge with an outline of <i>The Water of
Life</i> in something like the following form: A sick king has three
sons, who go out to seek some magical water (or bird, or fruit) for his
healing. The two older sons fall by the way into some misfortune due to
their own fault; but the youngest, not without aid of one sort or
another from beings with supernatural powers, succeeds in the quest and
at the same time wins a princess as wife. While returning, he rescues
his brothers, and is exposed by their envy and ingratitude to the loss
of all he has gained (sometimes even of his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>life). In the end, however, he comes to his own
either because the cure cannot be completed without him or because his
wife brings the older princes to book.</p>
<p>This summary I should be unwilling to have considered as anything
more than a tentative sketch, since a systematic study of the material
may bring to light certain features which I have overlooked.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e5417src" href="#xd20e5417" name=
"xd20e5417src">14</a> It will, however, serve its purpose here.</p>
<p>This simple form of <i>The Water of Life</i> is not that with which
<i>The Grateful Dead</i> has combined. Indeed, the opinion that this
union was secondary to that of <i>The Grateful Dead</i> with <i>The
Poison Maiden</i> and <i>The Ransomed Woman</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e5437src" href="#xd20e5437" name="xd20e5437src">15</a> is
strengthened by the fact that it is found with both of these compound
types, and that <i>The Water of Life</i> almost invariably appears in a
somewhat distorted form. In point of fact, the latter tale seems to
have lent itself with remarkable facility to combination with other
themes. Thus it is frequently found mixed with <i>The Skilful
Companions</i><a class="noteref" id="xd20e5446src" href="#xd20e5446"
name="xd20e5446src">16</a> (both with <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>and without <i>The
Grateful Dead</i>), <i>The Lady and the Monster</i>,<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e5524src" href="#xd20e5524" name="xd20e5524src">17</a> and
<i>The Thankful Beasts</i>.</p>
<p>The reason for the existence of the compounds just mentioned is not
far to seek. With <i>The Skilful Companions</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e5543src" href="#xd20e5543" name="xd20e5543src">18</a> there is a
ready point of contact in the hero&rsquo;s need for aid in the
accomplishment of his quest, another in the circumstance that three or
more companions set out together with a common end in view, and still
another in the fact that a maiden is rescued by them. To <i>The Lady
and the Monster</i>, at least in those variants where <i>The Grateful
Dead</i> appears, <i>The Water of Life</i> has the necessary approach
in the r&ocirc;le of the lady herself. As for <i>The Thankful
Beasts</i>, their appearance at opportune <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb127" href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>moments when the
heroes of folk-tales need assistance is too frequent to require
justification in any particular case. It is with such combinations as
these, intricate and involved, that many variants of <i>The Grateful
Dead</i> are found joined. Sometimes one element, sometimes another,
predominates, so that the threads which unite them are hopelessly
snarled. Sometimes <i>The Water of Life</i> is lost in the
entanglement, or only appears as a distorted trait, while <i>The
Skilful Companions</i> or <i>The Lady and the Monster</i> come out more
clearly. Through this labyrinth we must painfully take our way,
exercising what caution we can. The present guide recognizes the danger
of losing the road and does not pretend to more than a rough and ready
knowledge of the wilderness. Accordingly, he undertakes only to conduct
the curious wayfarer by the least difficult of the paths that traverse
it.</p>
<p>Let us first consider the tales into which <i>The Poison Maiden</i>
and <i>The Ransomed Woman</i> do not enter, which have only <i>The
Grateful Dead</i> + <i>The Water of Life</i> or some kindred theme.
These include <i>Maltese, Polish</i>, <i>Hungarian I., Rumanian II.,
Straparola II., Venetian</i>, <i>Sicilian, Treu Heinrich</i>, and
<i>Harz II.</i> They are as widely different in their characteristics
as in their sources.</p>
<p><i>Maltese</i> has the following form: The three sons of a king
successively go out in search of a bird, the song of which will make
their father young. The elder two lose their all by gambling with a
maiden in a palace by the way. The youngest brother pays four thousand
pounds sterling to bury properly a man who has been dead eight months.
He is warned against the maiden by a ghost, and so wins all from her
(by using his own cards), thus rescuing his brothers. When he comes to
the castle, the ghost again appears, and tells him to take the bird
that he finds in a dirty cage. On the way back he is thrown overboard
from the steamboat by his brothers, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb128" href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>but is saved by the
ghost, who appears in the form of a rock with a tree on it. He is
rescued by another steamer, and comes home in rags, where he is
recognized by the bird, which has hitherto refused to sing. The
brothers are banished.</p>
<p>According to the <i>Polish</i> story, a poor scholar pays his all
for the burial of a corpse lying maltreated by the way. Later he goes
to sleep under an oak, and on awaking finds his purse full of gold. He
is robbed of this while crossing a stream, by some scoundrels who cast
him into the water; but he is rescued by the ghost of the dead man, who
appears in the form of a plank and gives him the power of turning
himself into a crow, a hare, or a deer. He becomes a huntsman to a
king, whose daughter lives on an inaccessible island. In her castle is
a sword with which a man could overcome the greatest army. When war
threatens, the king offers the princess to any man who can obtain the
sword. By means of his power of metamorphosis the hero carries her a
letter and wins her love. When he exhibits his magical powers, she cuts
off a bit of the fur, or a feather, from each creature into which he
turns. With the sword he then starts back to court, but on the way he
is shot by a rival and robbed of the sword and a letter from the
princess. He lies in the way in the form of a dead hare till the war is
ended and the rival is about to marry the princess, when he is revived
and warned by the ghost. At court he is recognized by the princess, who
proves his tale by having him turn into various shapes and fitting the
samples which she has taken.</p>
<p>In <i>Hungarian I.</i> a soldier gave all he had to an old beggar,
who in turn gave him the power to change at will into a dove, a fish,
or a hare. He took service with a king, and one day was sent back to
the castle for a magic ring. There he met the princess, and exhibited
to her his powers of metamorphosis, permitting her to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>pull
two feathers, take eight scales, and cut off his tail. While running
back to the king in the form of a hare, he was shot by an envious
comrade, who took the ring and was rewarded. The hero was restored to
life by the old beggar, and returned to the castle, where he was
brought to the princess. She succeeded in proving the truth of his
story by means of the feathers, the scales, and the tail, which she had
so fortunately preserved.</p>
<p><i>Rumanian II.</i>, though changed into legendary form, does not
differ greatly from the two variants just cited. A shepherd boy gave
his one sheep to Christ, when He asked for food. In return, he received
a knife with three blades. Later he took service with a man, with whom
he entered the army of the emperor. One day the monarch found that he
had forgotten his ring, and promised half his kingdom to anybody who
could bring it to him from the palace within twenty-four hours. By
means of his magical knife the hero changed into a hare, obtained the
emperor&rsquo;s ring as well as one from the princess&rsquo;s own hand,
and returned to the army. There he was met by his master, who plundered
him, threw him into a spring, and went to the emperor for reward. When
the battle was over and all had returned to the capital, the princess
said that the man who was presented as her bridegroom was not he to
whom she gave the ring. Meanwhile, Christ had rescued the hero from the
spring and sent him to the palace in the form of a fox with his ring in
a basket. The princess recognized from the token that he was her true
bridegroom, and brought him to the emperor.</p>
<p><i>Straparola II.</i> introduces certain new elements to our notice.
A king&rsquo;s son releases a wild man, whom his father has
incarcerated, in order to get back an arrow that the man has taken from
him. The man is really a disappointed lover, who had given himself up
to a savage life. The boy&rsquo;s mother, in fear of the king, sends
him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>away in the care of two faithful servants, with
whom he lives in obscurity till he is sixteen years old. Covetous of
his wealth, they are about to kill him, when the wild man, transformed
into a splendid knight by a grateful fairy, joins them. They go to a
beautiful city called Ireland, which is devastated by a ferocious horse
and an equally savage mare. The traitorous servants plot to destroy the
prince by giving out, first, that he has boasted that he can overcome
the horse, and, second, the mare. By the advice of his unknown friend
and the help of the latter&rsquo;s fairy horse, he accomplishes these
labours. He is told by the king that he may have one of his daughters
in marriage, if he can tell which has hair of gold. He is told by his
companion that a hornet, which he has released, will appear at the test
and fly three times around the head of the princess whom he is to
choose. The man explains at the same time the cause of his
benevolence,&mdash;gratitude because by him he has been delivered from
death. The prince is thus enabled to pick out the princess with golden
hair, and is married to her, while his companion receives the
sister.</p>
<p>In the <i>Venetian</i> tale, again a peculiar variant, twelve
brothers seek twelve sisters as wives. Eleven of them go out at first,
and are turned to stone. The youngest brother sets out after a year,
and on the way has a poor dead man buried. Later, when he has saved his
eleven brothers, they become envious, and throw him into a well. The
thankful dead man then comes, draws him out with a cord, and explains
who he is. The hero proceeds to his home and tells his story.</p>
<p><i>Sicilian</i> is more extended but less difficult to place. The
three orphaned sons of a rich man try to win the daughter of a certain
king, who has announced that he will marry the princess to anyone who
can make a ship that will travel alike on land and water. The eldest
and middle brothers are unsuccessful because they are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>unkind to the poor who ask for work. The
youngest brother gives work to both old and young, and, when an old man
(St. Joseph) appears, makes him overseer. After the work is done, he
agrees to give half of what he obtains to the old man, and goes with
him in the ship to court. On the way he takes in a man who is found
putting clouds in a sack, another who is bearing half a forest on his
back, another who has drunk half a stream, another who is aiming his
bow at a quail in the underworld, and another who stands with one foot
at Catania and the other at Messina. At the court the king refuses to
give up his daughter till the hero can send a message to the underworld
and get an answer in an hour, which he does by means of the
long-strider and the shooter; and till he can find a man who will drink
half the contents of his cellar in one day, which the drinker easily
accomplishes. The king then offers as dowry only what one man can carry
away, but he is foiled by the man who bore half the forest on his back,
who now takes all the contents of the palace and departs with the hero,
the princess, and their companions. The king pursues them, but is
befogged by the man with the clouds. When they arrive at home, the
saint demands his half, even of the king&rsquo;s daughter; but when the
hero takes his sword to divide her, he cries out that he merely wished
to test his faithfulness.</p>
<p>In <i>Treu Heinrich</i> a noble youth lost his property through
prodigality in tournaments. Finally he sold his all to enter a tourney
for the hand of the daughter of the King of Cyprus, but he gave half to
his faithful follower Heinrich. After they set out for Cyprus, they
were joined by a knight, who shared the hero&rsquo;s hospitality for
fourteen days, agreeing to do the same in return, but at last riding
away. In destitution they arrived at Famagust in Cyprus. While Heinrich
was in the city, the hero found a clear stone left by a bird, through
which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>he obtained power to become a bird. He then
established himself in the city, met the princess with the result that
they fell in love, and flew to her chamber as a bird. He obtained from
her not only his desire but an ornament which he gave to the strange
knight, who had again joined him. Later he overcame this knight in the
tourney, but the latter was mistaken for himself. Again he flew to the
princess, who gave him a crown, and again, after giving it to the
stranger, he overcame him in a fight. The princess now gave him a
helmet, which he kept; and he was proclaimed victor of the jousting.
Once more he flew to the princess, and obtained from her an ornament
for his helmet, made by herself. Thus he won her as wife.</p>
<p>In <i>Harz II.</i> our primary motive is far less obscure than in
the version just summarized. A youth pays his all, thirty-eight
dollars, to free a dead man from indebtedness. He goes his way, and
meets a young fellow, who accompanies him. They fall in with a man
bearing two trees, a man with a hat on one side, a man with a wooden
leg, and a man with a blind eye. The six go together to a city, where
the princess can be won only by performing feats, with the penalty of
death attached to failure. The companions aid the hero by bringing
water from a distant spring and by keeping a fiery furnace habitable,
so that he wins the princess.</p>
<p>These nine variants are, it will be seen, related in very different
degrees to <i>The Grateful Dead</i>. What a debased type of the
<i lang="de">m&auml;rchen</i> they represent is shown by the fact that
in no less than five<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5672src" href=
"#xd20e5672" name="xd20e5672src">19</a> the burial of the corpse, which
is the most fundamental trait of the theme, has been lost. Yet for two
reasons it is clear that they are really scions of the stock. In the
first place, wherever the burial has been cut away, other elements of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>the motive in its simple form have been
retained. Thus in <i>Hungarian I.</i> and <i>Rumanian II.</i> the deeds
of the old beggar (or Christ) make his identity with the ghost
unquestionable; in <i>Straparola II.</i>, despite its sophistication,
the wild man fills the same r&ocirc;le, while his explanations at the
end show that the burial has been merely blurred; in <i>Sicilian</i>
both the agreement to divide and the division of the woman as a test
are introduced; and in <i>Treu Heinrich</i> there is double division in
a way, since the hero divides his property with his faithful follower
to begin with and afterwards agrees to an exchange of hospitality with
the helpful knight, going so far as actually to give him two of the
four gifts received from the princess. In the second place, certain
variants without the burial are very closely allied with others which
retain it,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5698src" href="#xd20e5698" name=
"xd20e5698src">20</a> as will be seen in a moment. Thus all those
treated here may safely be admitted to the group.</p>
<p>The reader must, however, have been struck, while examining the
summaries just given, with the great diversity of the residuum which
would be left if the parts properly belonging to <i>The Grateful
Dead</i> were taken away. Indeed, they may be separated on this score
into four categories with a couple of minor divisions. <i>Polish,
Hungarian I.</i>, and <i>Rumanian II.</i> are very similar in respect
to these matters, having a princess who is won by the feat of obtaining
something left at home by her father (this feat made possible by the
power given the hero to change his form) and a treacherous rival.
<i>Polish</i> has the peculiarity that the article to be obtained by
the hero is a magical sword.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5726src" href=
"#xd20e5726" name="xd20e5726src">21</a> <i>Treu Heinrich</i> stands a
little apart from these, since the rival does not appear <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>and
the princess is won by a tourney; yet it has the curious metamorphosis,
and must be considered as having some connection. <i>Maltese</i> and
<i>Venetian</i> fall together. <i>Venetian</i> has retained from <i>The
Water of Life</i> only the misfortune and the treachery of the older
brothers,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5754src" href="#xd20e5754" name=
"xd20e5754src">22</a> while <i>Maltese</i> keeps also the magical bird
and the features naturally connected therewith. The introduction of two
steamboats in the latter is a curious illustration of the ease with
which popular tales change details without altering essentials.
<i>Sicilian</i> and <i>Harz II.</i> again are alike, both being
compounded with <i>The Skilful Companions</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e5772src" href="#xd20e5772" name="xd20e5772src">23</a> and making
the winning of the princess depend on feats really accomplished by the
helpers characteristic to that tale. <i>Straparola II.</i> must be
placed alone, having nearly all trace of <i>The Water of Life</i> lost
in the traits of <i>The Lady and the Monster</i>, with a princess won
by the hero&rsquo;s happily directed choice.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e5791src" href="#xd20e5791" name="xd20e5791src">24</a></p>
<p>All of these features will appear again when we come to discuss
variants which combine the compound types <i>The Grateful Dead</i> +
<i>The Poison Maiden</i> or <i>The Ransomed Woman</i> with <i>The Water
of Life</i>. They may, therefore, be passed over for the present,
together with the question as to whether such a simple combination as
<i>The Grateful Dead</i> + <i>The Water of Life</i> may be regarded as
being the original from which the more complicated types have sprung.
It is sufficient for the moment to recognize the tendency of the
simpler variants to fall <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href=
"#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>into groups on the basis of the
residuum left by subtracting traits belonging to <i>The Grateful
Dead</i>.</p>
<p>Let us now consider the tales where a thankful beast plays the part
of the grateful dead through at least a portion of the narrative, and
where there is still no trace of either <i>The Poison Maiden</i> or
<i>The Ransomed Woman</i>. The change of beast for ghost is so obvious
and easy that the separation of these variants from the preceding
appears at first sight to be of merely formal use. Yet thus considered,
they may serve to define the sub-divisions already noticed. Nine such
versions have come to my knowledge: <i>Walewein, Lotharingian,
Tuscan</i>, <i>Brazilian, Basque I., Breton IV., V.</i>, and
<i>VI.</i>, and <i>Simrock IX.</i> All but one are folk-tales, and
that, curiously enough, an episode in a thirteenth century<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e5844src" href="#xd20e5844" name=
"xd20e5844src">25</a> Dutch romance translated from the
French.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5847src" href="#xd20e5847" name=
"xd20e5847src">26</a></p>
<p><i>Walewein</i>, the variant in question, has the following form:
Walewein (or more familiarly Gawain) sets forth from Arthur&rsquo;s
court to secure a magical chessboard. He is promised it by King Wonder
if only he will get the sword of rings from King Amoris, who in turn
will give that up if Walewein will bring him the princess of the Garden
of India. On this quest the hero mortally wounds a certain Red Knight,
who prays him for Christian burial and is properly interred. He then
proceeds to the castle of King Assentin, whose daughter recognizes in
him the ideal knight whom she has seen in a dream. He is led under the
dark river which surrounds the castle by the Fox Rog&egrave;s, and wins
the princess. The lovers and the fox (a prince transformed) escape by
the help of the Red Knight&rsquo;s ghost. After many adventures they
come together to the court with a chessboard, which is given up by King
Wonder in exchange for the sword. Walewein is able to keep the princess
for his own because of the death of Amoris. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Lotharingian</i> runs as follows: A king has three sons. He sends
them successively to seek the water of life. Two of them refuse to help
a shepherd on the way, and rest from their search in Pekin. The third,
who is deformed, aids the shepherd, and receives from him some arrows,
which will pierce well whatever they strike, and a flageolet, which
will make everyone dance within hearing of it. Arrived at Pekin, the
humpback pays the debts of a corpse, and has it buried. He goes on till
his money is exhausted. When he is about to shoot a fox one day, he is
stayed by pity, and is directed by the creature to the castle where the
water of life is to be found. There he is detained by an ogre, and wins
battles for him by the aid of the magical arrows. There is a princess
in the castle, who refuses to marry the ogre. The hero makes her dance,
and obtains from the ogre as recompense the promise of whatever he
wishes. He asks for the most beautiful thing there and the right to
circle the castle three times. So he takes the princess, a phial of the
water of life, as well as the uglier of the two mules and of the two
green birds, as the fox has told him, and flees away. He meets the fox
again, and is warned not to help any one in trouble. Nevertheless, he
rescues his two brothers from the scaffold in Pekin, and is cast into a
well by them. They go home, but are not able to heal the king.
Meanwhile, the prince is saved by the fox, and is made straight of
body. He goes home, and at his coming the king becomes young again,
while the brothers are burned. So the prince marries the lady.</p>
<p>In <i>Tuscan</i> we learn that the youngest of three princes, while
wandering, paid the debts of a man whose corpse was being insulted.
When he had buried the man, he found himself without a farthing, and so
slept in the forest. In the morning he was greeted by a hare
(<i>lieprina</i>) with a basket of food in its mouth. He took
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>this gladly, and reflected that the creature
must be the soul of the man whom he had buried. He then came to an inn,
and took service with the host, whose beautiful daughter he soon
discovered to be a princess, who had been bought while an infant. After
winning her love, the hero went on into two kingdoms, where he obtained
a magical purse and a wonderful horse from two ugly daughters of
innkeepers. With these possessions he returned to the princess, and
started with her for his home. On the way he saved from death his two
older brothers, who had gone out to seek adventures at the same time as
himself. They repaid the kindness by trying to drown him and by
carrying the princess off home, where only by feigning illness could
she frustrate their plan that she choose one of them as husband.
Meanwhile, the hero was rescued from drowning by the hare, and came
home. By pretending to be a physician he obtained access to the
princess, was recognized, and then revealed himself to his father.</p>
<p>The <i>Brazilian</i> tale is brief but not unusual in type. A
prince, while seeking a remedy for his father, passes through a town
and sees a corpse, which is held for debt. He pays the creditors, and
has the corpse buried. Later he is met by a fox, which helps him obtain
not only the remedy for his father but in addition a princess as his
wife. On its last appearance the beast declares that it is the soul of
the man whom he buried.</p>
<p><i>Basque I.</i> has the following form: Three sons go out to seek a
white blackbird by which their father can be healed. Two of them get
into debt to the same three ladies, and, according to the custom of the
land, are imprisoned. The third son resists the sirens, ransoms his
brothers, and also pays the debts of a dead man, whose corpse is being
maltreated. He arrives at the house of the king who has the white
blackbird, and is told to get a certain young woman from another king.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>He goes far on till he comes near the castle,
where he meets a fox and is instructed by it to enter a certain room,
in which he will find the lady dressed in poor clothing. He must have
her put on good clothes, and she will sing. He follows the advice, but
is interrupted, while the lady is singing, by the king of the castle,
who tells him that he must get a white horse from still another king.
He meets the fox again, and is instructed that, when he finds the horse
with an old saddle on it, he must put on a good one, so that it will
neigh. Again he follows the fox&rsquo;s advice, and is interrupted by
people who rush in when they hear the horse neigh. From them he obtains
the steed, and retraces his steps, eloping with the lady at the second
king&rsquo;s castle and at the first king&rsquo;s carrying off the
blackbird. On his arrival at home he is thrown into a cistern by his
treacherous brothers, who take his spoil to the king. He is saved by
the fox, however, which draws him out with its tail. When he comes into
the presence of his father, and not till then, is the healing
accomplished.</p>
<p>In <i>Breton IV.</i> we find again three sons of a king, who set
forth to get the white blackbird and also the lady with locks of gold.
Jeannot, the youngest of them, pays for the interment of a beggar on
the way. Later a fox comes to him, saying that it is the soul of the
poor man. It helps him procure the youth-giving blackbird and afterward
the lady with the marvellous hair. He then meets his brothers, who for
envy push him over a precipice, but he is saved and sent homeward by
the fox.</p>
<p><i>Breton V.</i> does not differ materially from the preceding,
though it has interesting minor variations. The three sons of a king
seek the bird Dr&eacute;daine in its golden cage in order to cure their
father. The two elder brothers go to England, and there meet jolly
companions, but find no trace of the bird. The third brother, the ugly
one, comes thither, is mocked and robbed by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>them, but goes his way. One night he lodges in a
forest hut, and there finds a man&rsquo;s body, which the widow cannot
bury for lack of money to pay the priest. He is now poor, but pays for
the interment of the corpse, and proceeds. He is followed by a white
fox, which instructs him how to achieve his quest. He soon reaches the
castle, traverses three courts, comes to one chamber where he finds a
piece of inexhaustible bread, enters a second where he gets an
unfailing pot of wine and makes love to a sleeping princess, and goes
on to a third where he finds a magical sword and the bird. He hastens
away with his booty, guided for a time by the fox, sells his bread and
his wine to innkeepers on condition that they be given up to the
princess if ever she comes for them, and arrives at the city where his
brothers are now in prison. He ransoms them by helping the king, and
pays their debts by selling his sword. On their way home he is thrown
into a well by his brothers, who take the bird to their father, but do
not succeed in curing him. Meanwhile, the hero is saved by the fox,
which now explains that it is the soul of the man whom he has buried,
and definitely disappears. He arrives at his home as a beggar, and
takes service with his father. Later the princess comes thither with
the son that is the fruit of their union, and brings with her the
bread, wine, and sword which she has found on the way. The bird sings,
the king is healed, and the wicked brothers are executed.</p>
<p><i>Breton VI.</i> lacks some of the interesting traits of the
variant just given, but embroiders the theme with considerable grace.
The three sons of a king set out to find the princess of Hungary, who
has the only remedy that will cure their father. The eldest forgets his
purpose, and wastes his money in rioting. The second finds him just as
he is being led to death on account of debt, ransoms him, and shares
his riotous pleasures. The third <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140"
href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>brother, a humpback, goes out
with little money, but on his way procures burial for a man&rsquo;s
corpse, which the widow has been unable to do because of lack of money
to pay the priest. The next day a fox with a white tail meets him, and
in return for a bit of cake leads him to the castle of a princess.
There the prince resists the lady&rsquo;s advances, which he suspects
are derisive, and is sent to her sister&rsquo;s castle, where he has
the same experience. When he arrives at the castle of the third sister,
he yields to her proposals, is given the remedy for his father and a
magical sword, and is told how to go home. On the way he rescues his
brothers from the scaffold by waving his sword, and is robbed and
thrown into a well by them. Thence he is rescued by the fox, which
comes at his call, and before it disappears explains that it is the
ghost. Meanwhile, the older brothers have cured the king by the water
of life in a phial; so when the hero comes home he is not believed. In
a year and a day the princess arrives there according to her promise,
and with a little son. At a feast she proclaims the truth, cuts her
husband into bits, sprinkles the heap of fragments with the water of
life, and marries the handsome youth who at once arises&mdash;the
humpback transformed.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5901src" href=
"#xd20e5901" name="xd20e5901src">27</a></p>
<p>According to <i>Simrock IX.</i>, finally, the three sons of a king
seek the bird ph&oelig;nix to cure their blind father. The two elder
enter the castle of a beautiful maiden, and are lost; but the youngest
resists the temptation, and takes lodging at an inn. There at night he
is startled by a ghost, which tells him that it is the spirit of a man
whom the host has buried in the cellar for non-payment of a score, and
which implores his help. The youth arranges for payment of the debt and
for proper burial, then goes his way. In the wood he meets a wolf,
which instructs him how to find the bird ph&oelig;nix in a cage in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>the magical castle, and carries him thither.
Because he fails to take the worse-looking bird according to
instructions, he has to get a steed as swift as wind for the lord of
the castle. Again he is disobedient when told to take the worst-looking
horse only, and so has to get the most beautiful woman in the world for
the lord of this castle. Again he is brought by the wolf to a castle,
where he obediently chooses a black maiden instead of one who is
apparently beautiful. With maiden, horse, and bird he turns home. The
wolf in parting from him explains that it is the ghost of the dead man,
and warns him not to buy gallows flesh. When he meets his brothers on
their way to be hanged, however, he forgets this, and ransoms them. In
return he is nearly murdered by them and left for dead, but is rescued
and healed by the wolf, and so at last reaches his destination.</p>
<p>In none of these nine stories is the burial of the dead, one of the
two most fundamental features of our leading motive, in any way
obscured. They are thus less difficult to treat than was the preceding
group, in spite of the added complications introduced by the advent of
the helpful animal. This creature should naturally take the role of the
ghost, appear as the embodiment of the dead man&rsquo;s soul indeed;
and with but two exceptions<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5913src" href=
"#xd20e5913" name="xd20e5913src">28</a> it actually fulfils the part.
In those two there has been, apparently, imperfect amalgamation, so
that the helper is duplicated, and the motivation obscured. In
<i>Walewein</i>, a literary version, consciously adapted to the
requirements of a <i lang="fr">roman d&rsquo;aventure</i>, this need
excite no wonder. The ghost does its part properly, and the fox is
merely an additional agency in the service of the hero, acting out of
pure kindness of heart<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5927src" href=
"#xd20e5927" name="xd20e5927src">29</a> as far as one can see.
<i>Lotharingian</i>, not contented with duplicating the trait,
triplicates it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142"
name="pb142">142</a>]</span>The fox, as in the ordinary form of <i>The
Thankful Beasts</i>, helps the hero because of a benefit received; the
shepherd bestows magical gifts, as in a common type of <i>The Water of
Life</i>, because of the hero&rsquo;s kindness; while the dead debtor
remains inactive after the burial, and plays no further part in the
narrative.</p>
<p>As for <i>The Water of Life</i>, there are fewer complications in
this group than in that where the thankful beast does not appear. In
all of the variants some of the fundamental traits of the theme remain
intact. In all save <i>Walewein</i> and <i>Brazilian</i> (which is a
degenerate form presumably carried across the sea by Spaniards or
Portuguese) the three brothers set out from home in quite the normal
way. <i>Walewein</i> again lacks the water of life, which
<i>Brazilian</i> retains. All the other versions, save <i>Tuscan</i>,
keep this water or replace it by some other restorative agency. Two
variants only fail to make the older brothers act treacherously towards
the hero, these being again <i>Walewein</i> and <i>Brazilian</i>. The
former thus lacks three of the essentials of the theme, the latter two.
Yet since <i>Walewein</i> makes the hero win his princess by going on
from adventure to adventure quite in the normal manner, and since
<i>Brazilian</i> makes him obtain both water of life and princess,
though with loss of interesting details, we are surely justified in
placing both in this category.</p>
<p>It is worth our while to note in this connection that all these nine
variants come from southern Europe, directly or by derivation.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e5980src" href="#xd20e5980" name=
"xd20e5980src">30</a> Geographical proximity, though not sufficient in
itself as a basis of classification, adds welcome confirmation to other
proof in cases like this, where a small group of highly complicated
tales is found to exist in neighbouring countries only. That
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span><i>Walewein</i> can be connected with this
specialized sub-division has important bearings on the question whence
the material for that romance was taken. In view of the limited
territory which this form of the story has covered as a folk-tale in
six hundred years, and the fact that France would be the centre of the
region, it seems fair to assume that some thirteenth century French
writer took a <i lang="de">m&auml;rchen</i> of his own land as the
basis for his work, thus elaborating with native material the
adventures of a Celtic hero.</p>
<p>The question now arises as to what light the group just considered
throws upon the variants which combine the simple theme of <i>The
Grateful Dead</i> with <i>The Water of Life</i> or some such motive. It
appeared, the reader will remember, that according to the elements
foreign to the main motive they must be separated into four classes.
Reference to these classes<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6003src" href=
"#xd20e6003" name="xd20e6003src">31</a> will show that the variants
with <i>The Thankful Beasts</i> are in many respects different from any
one of them as far as the features peculiar to <i>The Water of
Life</i>, or kindred themes, are concerned. Yet because <i>Maltese</i>
and the brief <i>Venetian</i>, though otherwise transformed, are the
only tales aside from these<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6019src" href=
"#xd20e6019" name="xd20e6019src">32</a> that preserve the treachery of
the hero&rsquo;s brothers, it is safe to class them together. Both
<i>Maltese</i> and <i>Venetian</i> come, it will be observed, from the
same general region as all the other members of the group.</p>
<p>Since the elements left by subtracting <i>The Grateful Dead</i> from
the variants of the four categories thus discovered are very diverse,
we cannot postulate a parent form from which all four classes might
have sprung. Indeed, the evidence thus far obtained all points to a
separate combination of already developed themes with <i>The Grateful
Dead</i>. The test of this will be found in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>an
examination of those variants of those larger compounds, which have
also traces of <i>The Water of Life</i> or some allied motive.</p>
<p>Turning first to such versions of the combination <i>The Grateful
Dead</i> + <i>The Poison Maiden</i>, we find eleven on our list, all of
which have already been summarized and discussed in connection with the
simple compound.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6049src" href="#xd20e6049"
name="xd20e6049src">33</a> These are <i>Esthonian II., Rumanian I.,
Irish I., Irish II.</i>, <i>Irish III., Danish III., Norwegian II.,
Simrock X.</i>, <i>Harz I., Jack the Giant-Killer</i>, and <i>Old
Wives&rsquo; Tale</i>. Since we know definitely that <i>Danish III.</i>
(the tale by Christian Andersen) was taken from <i>Norwegian II.</i>,
it may be left out of account. Ten variants thus remain to be studied
with reference to the subsidiary elements.</p>
<p>In <i>Esthonian II.</i> the hero releases a princess, who goes with
devils every night to church, by watching in the church for three
nights with three, six, and twelve candles on successive nights. In
<i>Rumanian I.</i> the hero wins a princess by explaining why she wears
out twelve pairs of slippers every night; and he accomplishes this by
the aid of his helper, who follows the lady in the form of a cat, and
picks up the handkerchief, spoon, and ring which she drops in the house
of the dragons. According to <i>Irish I.</i> the helper obtains for the
hero horses of gold and silver, a sword of light, a cloak of darkness,
and a pair of slippery shoes; he helps him keep over night a comb and a
pair of scissors, in spite of enchantment, and finally gets the lips of
the giant enchanter, so that the hero unspells and wins the lady of his
quest. In <i>Irish II.</i> the hero is joined by a green man (the
grateful dead), a gunner, a listener, a blower, and a strong man. By
the aid of the first he gives his princess a pair of scissors, a comb,
and the enchanter&rsquo;s head; by the aid of the others he obtains
water from the well of the western world, and is enabled to walk over
three miles of needles. <i>Irish III.</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>has a helper who
obtains for the hero a sword, a cloak of darkness, and swift shoes,
rescues a pair of scissors, and obtains the enchanter&rsquo;s head,
while the hero wins a race by the aid of the shoes. According to
<i>Norwegian II.</i> the hero and helper get a sword, a ball of yarn,
and a hat, while the latter follows the princess and rescues a pair of
scissors and a ball, finally obtaining the troll&rsquo;s head. In
<i>Simrock X.</i> the helper secures three rods, a sword, and a pair of
wings, follows the princess, and learns how to answer her riddles,
emphasizing his knowledge by getting the wizard&rsquo;s head. <i>Harz
I.</i> has the helper give wings and a rod to the hero, who flies with
the princess and learns to guess her riddles, cutting off the
monster&rsquo;s head. In <i>Jack the Giant-Killer</i> Jack obtains
gold, a coat and cap, a sword, and a pair of slippers for his master,
follows the princess, and secures the handkerchief and the
demon&rsquo;s head, which are requisite to the unspelling. Finally,
according to <i>Old Wives&rsquo; Tale</i>, the helper, while invisible,
slays the conjuror, and so obtains the princess for his master.</p>
<p>It will at once be recognized that all of these variants are of one
type as far as the traits just specified are concerned. The basal
element is the hero&rsquo;s success in winning an enchanted princess
either by accomplishing difficult feats or answering riddles. The water
of life, as such, appears in only one story, <i>Irish II.</i>, and
there not as the prime goal of the hero&rsquo;s quest, but merely as
the object of a subsidiary labour. Clearly these tales not only form a
group by themselves, but have in combination with <i>The Grateful
Dead</i> and <i>The Poison Maiden</i> a theme which is not properly
<i>The Water of Life</i>. This theme is as clearly <i>The Lady and the
Monster</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6124src" href="#xd20e6124"
name="xd20e6124src">34</a> which is closely allied to <i>The Water of
Life</i>, but is essentially distinct. It has already been found
compounded with the simple form of <i>The Grateful Dead</i> in the
somewhat <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>degenerate and literary <i>Straparola
II.</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6138src" href="#xd20e6138" name=
"xd20e6138src">35</a> though the method by which the enchanted princess
was won in that variant was different from that given in the present
group.</p>
<p>Within the group there are minor differences with reference to the
manner of unspelling the princess, which resolve themselves either, on
the one hand, into the hero&rsquo;s keeping or obtaining something for
her, or, on the other, into his guessing the object of her thoughts.
These details are not, however, of much importance for the purpose in
hand, though they might become so if an attempt were made to sub-divide
the group. Thus <i>Esthonian II.</i> is decidedly unusual in its
treatment of the matter just mentioned. <i>Irish I.</i> has traces of

Friends</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6158src" href="#xd20e6158"
name="xd20e6158src">37</a> In <i>Harz I.</i> the hero himself follows
the princess instead of leaving the actual work of unspelling to the
helper, as is elsewhere the case. <i>Irish II.</i>, finally, is
peculiar not only in bringing in <i>The Water of Life</i>, as mentioned
above, but also the motive of <i>The Skilful Companions</i>, which we
have already met with in Sicilian and <i>Harz II.</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd20e6176src" href="#xd20e6176" name="xd20e6176src">38</a></p>
<p><i>Irish II.</i> is, indeed, of great importance to our study at
this point. It is in some way a link between <i>Sicilian</i> and
<i>Harz II.</i> and the subdivision now under discussion. Furthermore,
the fact that <i>Straparola II.</i> has some traits of <i>The Lady and
the Monster</i> in common with all the members of the group under
consideration shows that it can safely be placed in the same category
as <i>Sicilian</i> and <i>Harz II.</i> Though the feats by which the
princess is won are somewhat different in the last-named variants from
the feats in <i>Straparola II.</i> on the one hand and in the compound
<i>The Grateful Dead</i> + <i>The Poison Maiden</i> + <i>The Water of
Life</i> (<i>The Lady and the Monster</i>) on the other, there can be
little doubt, it seems <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href=
"#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>to me, that all of them belong
together. <i>Irish II.</i> by the introduction of <i>The Skilful
Companions</i> thus furnishes a clue by which the tales having the
compound just mentioned may be classed with two varieties of the simple
combination, and permits us to reduce the total number of categories
with reference to <i>The Water of Life</i> from four to three.</p>
<p>Before proceeding to a general discussion of the means by which this
theme was brought into connection with <i>The Grateful Dead</i> and the
comparative date of the combination or series of combinations, it is
necessary to examine four other versions,&mdash;those which have the
form <i>The Grateful Dead</i> + <i>The Ransomed Woman</i> + <i>The
Water of Life</i>. Like the group just treated, all of them have been
summarized and discussed with reference to the prime features of the
compound.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6249src" href="#xd20e6249" name=
"xd20e6249src">39</a> They are <i>Bohemian, Simrock I., Simrock
III.</i>, and <i>Simrock VII.</i></p>
<p>The elements of these variants, apart from those due to the main
compound, are as follows. In <i>Bohemian</i> the hero is given a flute
and a captive princess by his helper, and escapes with them from
prison. Later he is cast into the sea by a rival, but is rescued by the
helper and given a wishing ring. By means of this ring he turns first
into an eagle and afterwards into an old man, and succeeds in winning
the princess by building and painting a church. In <i>Simrock I.</i>
the hero is rescued by the helper after being cast overboard by a
rival, and is given the power of obtaining his wishes. Thereby he
paints three rooms to the liking of the princess, and is recognized by
her. <i>Simrock III.</i> differs from this only in making the helper do
the painting and in having one room painted instead of three. In
<i>Simrock VII.</i>, finally, the hero releases a princess by hewing
trees, separating grain, and choosing his mistress among three hundred
women, all without aid. Later he is rescued <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>from
the sea and recognized by means of a ring and a handkerchief.</p>
<p>The first three of these variants clearly show in the subsidiary
elements just enumerated their relationship to <i>The Water of
Life</i>. They lack the quest for some magical fountain or bird, to be
sure, but they preserve the quest for the lady, which is an important
factor in the <i>m&auml;rchen</i>. Of the three, <i>Bohemian</i> has
the most extended and probably the best presentation of the details of
the difficult courtship; and it gives the hero that power of
metamorphosis which was noted in four variants of the type <i>The
Grateful Dead</i> + <i>The Water of Life</i> simply. It may, therefore,
on the basis of general and particular resemblance be classed with
<i>Polish, Hungarian I., Rumanian II.</i>, and <i>Treu
Heinrich</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6299src" href="#xd20e6299"
name="xd20e6299src">40</a> Along with it, of course, go the briefer
<i>Simrock I.</i> and <i>Simrock III.</i> There is this important
difference between the two sets of tales, that in the simpler form the
princess is won by the hero&rsquo;s success in bringing something from
a distance, in the more complicated form by building and decorating.
Yet the resemblance is sufficient to warrant the classification
proposed.</p>
<p>With <i>Simrock VII.</i> the case is altogether different. There the
subsidiary elements are connected with <i>The Lady and the Monster</i>
rather than <i>The Water of Life</i> proper, yet not with that theme as
it appears in combination with <i>The Poison Maiden</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e6322src" href="#xd20e6322" name=
"xd20e6322src">41</a> since in that group the hero disenchants the
princess by guessing some secret, here by performing two feats of
prowess or discrimination and by choosing the proper lady from a host
of maidens. With <i>Straparola II.</i>, however, which has the simpler
combination <i>The Grateful Dead</i> + <i>The Lady and the Monster</i>,
the resemblance is very close,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6335src"
href="#xd20e6335" name="xd20e6335src">42</a> as both have the happily
directed choice. The complicated <i>Simrock VII.</i> thus falls into
the same category with reference <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149"
href="#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>to this matter as
<i>Straparola II., Sicilian</i>, and <i>Harz II.</i>, and the group
having the form <i>The Grateful Dead</i> + <i>The Poison Maiden</i> +
<i>The Water of Life</i> (<i>The Lady and the Monster</i>
specifically).</p>
<p>A summary of our three categories will be of service in discussing
their relations to one another and to the themes with which <i>The
Water of Life</i> or <i>The Lady and the Monster</i> are combined.</p>

<p>Class I. forms a territorially homogeneous group, all the members of
it coming from eastern and central Europe. It is not altogether
homogeneous in content, but preserves the theme of <i>The Water of
Life</i> proper in a form where the hero wins a princess by means,
among other feats, of metamorphosis. Class II. is the most widespread
of all territorially, as its members come from all parts of Europe. It
has instead of <i>The Water of Life</i> proper what must be regarded,
in the present <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>state of the evidence, as the closely allied
theme of <i>The Lady and the Monster</i>. Class III., the most compact
of all in the region that it inhabits, preserves <i>The Water of
Life</i> better than any other group, though not without frequent
admixture and, in many instances, the loss of some elements.</p>
<p>It has been stated above<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6507src" href=
"#xd20e6507" name="xd20e6507src">43</a> that it would be hard to
imagine such various traits coming from a single type of story. This
becomes even more evident from the tabulation just made. To suppose
that <i>The Grateful Dead</i> first united with <i>The Water of
Life</i>, and that this compound gave rise to the varieties, as
enumerated, would involve us in the direst confusion. If such were the
case, how could Class II. with its introduction of <i>The Lady and the
Monster</i> be explained? Why, moreover, should one variant having
<i>The Ransomed Woman</i> fall into Class II., while three others fall
into Class I.? Such an assumption, it is clear, would be
self-destructive.</p>
<p>The only alternative is to suppose that <i>The Water of Life</i>
entered into combination with simple or compound types of <i>The
Grateful Dead</i> at more than one time and in more than one region.
That <i>The Grateful Dead</i> united with <i>The Poison Maiden</i> and
<i>The Ransomed Woman</i> rather early and quite independently abundant
evidence goes to show; that <i>The Water of Life</i> is an independent
motive and that, like at least two of the other themes, it was of
Asiatic origin has likewise been made clear; that the latter could not
have united with <i>The Grateful Dead</i> so early as did <i>The Poison
Maiden</i> and <i>The Ransomed Woman</i> is proved by the discrepancies
noted above. If it be assumed, on the contrary, that after the
compounds <i>The Grateful Dead</i> + <i>The Poison Maiden</i> and
<i>The Ransomed Woman</i> had arisen, both they and the simple theme in
one or another form came into connection with one or another
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>form of <i>The Water of Life</i> our
difficulties are in great measure resolved.</p>
<p>With this in mind let us consider the three categories. Sometime
before the fourteenth century<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6569src" href=
"#xd20e6569" name="xd20e6569src">44</a> <i>The Water of Life</i>,
perhaps in a rather peculiar form, came into contact with <i>The
Grateful Dead</i>, both simple and combined with <i>The Ransomed
Woman</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6587src" href="#xd20e6587" name=
"xd20e6587src">45</a> in eastern or central Europe. With each form it
seems to have united, giving rise in the century named to the German
romance of <i>Treu Heinrich</i> and the legend of Nicholas by Gobius,
as well as, sooner or later, to the folk-tales with which it has been
found combined in those regions within the past hundred years. The
territorial limitation of the resulting type is a point in the favour
of the proposed theory, though I cannot but be aware that this may be
disturbed by a variant outside the seemingly fixed circle. Yet even so,
the relation of the variants of Class I. to the themes concerned
appears to be pretty definitely established. With Class III. the matter
is even simpler. According to my view, some form of <i>The Grateful
Dead</i>, more or less confused with one of the countless versions of
<i>The Thankful Beasts</i> met with a very clear type of <i>The Water
of Life</i> in southern or south-western Europe by or before the
thirteenth century.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6603src" href=
"#xd20e6603" name="xd20e6603src">46</a> With this it united and gave
rise to an Old French romance (later turned into Dutch) and to a
considerable body of folk-tales, which have not strayed far from the
point of departure save in one instance,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e6609src" href="#xd20e6609" name="xd20e6609src">47</a> where the
means of transmission is not difficult to ascertain. Apparently the
thankful beast was not absolutely in solution, since in <i>Maltese</i>
and <i>Venetian</i> the human ghost resumes its characteristic
r&ocirc;le.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6620src" href="#xd20e6620" name=
"xd20e6620src">48</a> With Class <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152"
href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>II. the case is different and
more difficult of explanation. Here the compound has no definite
territorial limits, and it is besides of a very complicated character.
We have to suppose that <i>The Lady and the Monster</i>, a
<i>m&auml;rchen</i> allied to <i>The Water of Life</i>, was afloat in
Europe somewhat before the early sixteenth century.<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e6637src" href="#xd20e6637" name="xd20e6637src">49</a> There it
met and united with <i>The Grateful Dead</i>, in its simple form on the
one hand, giving rise to three of our variants, and on the other hand
separately with the compounds having <i>The Poison Maiden</i> and
<i>The Ransomed Woman</i>. The former double compound must have been
made fairly early,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6649src" href=
"#xd20e6649" name="xd20e6649src">50</a> since it has been found in such
widely separated countries as Rumania and Ireland, and furnished one of
the most important elements to the making of a sixteenth century
English play, Peele&rsquo;s <i>Old Wives&rsquo; Tale</i>. The second of
the double compounds is unfortunately represented on our list by a
single folk-tale only, and may possibly be a later formation.</p>
<p>Such, then, seems to be the relationship of <i>The Water of Life</i>
and allied motives to the main theme of our study,&mdash;purely
subsidiary and relatively late. The theory which has been proposed
involves the necessity of placing the entrance of the Semitic
<i>m&auml;rchen</i> into Europe not much earlier than the twelfth
century, though such matters of chronology must be left somewhat to
speculation; it shows the points of contact between the various motives
concerned; and it avoids contradictions of space and time. Writer and
reader may perhaps congratulate themselves on finding so clear a road
through the maze. Should subsequent discovery of material necessitate
modification of the views here expressed, it should be welcomed by both
with equal pleasure. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153"

of completeness. Thus, for example, he does not use Cosquin&rsquo;s
valuable contributions in <i lang="fr">Contes populaires de

assistance. The theme yet awaits definitive treatment.</p>

the following references, some of which would otherwise be unknown to
me. In note 2 to p. 226 he says: &ldquo;See Benfey, <span lang=

venture to call the story of the woman, who through enchantment or her
own bad taste is the mistress of an ogre or some other monster. She is
rescued by a hero, who is able to solve the extraordinary riddles or to
accomplish the apparently impossible tasks which she sets him at the
advice of the monster, after other suitors have perished in the
attempt. See Kittredge, <i>Arthur and Gorlagon</i>, p. 250 (note to p.
249); Wesselofsky, <i>Arch. f. slav. Phil.</i> vi. 574. A good specimen
tale is &ldquo;The Magic Turban&rdquo; in R. Nisbet Bain&rsquo;s
<i>Turkish Fairy Tales</i>, 1901, pp. 102&ndash;111.</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=

Kittredge thus summarizes the tale (<i>work cited</i>, p. 226):
&ldquo;Three or more brothers (or comrades) are suitors for the hand of
a beautiful girl. While her father is deliberating, the girl
disappears. The companions undertake to recover her. One of them, by
contemplation (or by keenness of sight), finds that she has been stolen
by a demon (or dragon) and taken to his abode on a rock in the sea.
Another builds a ship by his magic (or possesses a magic ship) which
instantly transports them to the rock. Another, who is a skilful
climber, ascends the castle and finds that the monster is asleep with
his head in the maiden&rsquo;s lap. Another, a master thief, steals the
girl without waking her captor. They embark, but are pursued by the
monster. One of the companions, an unerring shot, kills the pursuer
with an arrow. The girl is restored to her parents.&rdquo; This
analysis would not hold for all variants, even when uncompounded
(<i>e.g.</i> Grimm, <i lang="de">Kinder- und Hausm&auml;rchen</i>, No.
71, &ldquo;<span lang="de">Sechse kommen durch die ganze
Welt</span>&rdquo;) but a better could scarcely be made without a
systematic study of the type. As Kittredge notes, the companions are
not at all constant in number and function.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Relations of <i>The Grateful Dead</i> to <i>The
Spendthrift Knight, The Two Friends</i>, and <i>The Thankful
Beasts</i>.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have met at various points in our study with tales
in which the motive of the hero&rsquo;s fateful journey was his
impoverishment through extravagance; we have seen that many variants
make the division of a child part of the agreement between the ghost
and the hero; and we have noted the appearance of the ghost in the form
of a beast in a large number of instances. The bearing of these
phenomena we shall do well to investigate before proceeding to general
conclusions. Occurring as they do in versions which have been assigned
on other accounts to different categories, are they of sufficient
importance to disturb the classification already proposed? Furthermore,
what cause can be found for their introduction? Are they in reality
sporadic, or are they the result of some determinable factor in the
history of the cycle?</p>
<p>Eleven variants, namely, <i>Richars, Oliver, Lope de Vega</i>,
<i>Dianese, Old Swedish, Icelandic I., Icelandic II., Rittertriuwe</i>,
<i>Treu Heinrich</i>, and <i>Sir Amadas</i>, have more or less clearly
expressed the motive of a knight who has exhausted his patrimony and
goes out to recruit his fortunes by winning a princess in a tourney.
The figure of such a knight or adventurer is not an uncommon one in the
fiction of Europe, and scarcely requires illustration. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>Of
the variants just named all except <i>Oliver</i>, <i>Lope de Vega</i>,
and <i>Old Swedish</i> actually state that the hero sets out from home
on account of his poverty. In the two former the motive of the
incestuous stepmother is introduced in place of this, and in <i>Old
Swedish</i> the trait is obscured without any substitution, implying
that the hero is led merely by ambition to undertake the tourney. On
the other hand, the tourney occurs in all save <i>Icelandic I.</i> and
<i>II.</i>, which are the only folk-tales in the list. The second of
these, moreover, makes the hero a merchant instead of a knight; but
since the two come from the same island and are in other respects
rather similar,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6727src" href="#xd20e6727"
name="xd20e6727src">1</a> this is perhaps not very significant.</p>
<p>Looking at the matter from another point of view, we find that
<i>Richars, Lion de Bourges, Dianese, Old Swedish, Rittertriuwe</i>,
and <i>Sir Amadas</i> form a group by themselves,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e6738src" href="#xd20e6738" name="xd20e6738src">2</a> and are
uncompounded with any one of the themes with which <i>The Grateful
Dead</i> is most frequently allied. <i>Oliver</i> and <i>Lope de
Vega</i> are treated under the compound with <i>The Ransomed Woman</i>,
where on account of the rescue of the hero by the ghost they probably
belong;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6754src" href="#xd20e6754" name=
"xd20e6754src">3</a> and <i>Icelandic I.</i> and <i>II.</i> are clearly
of that type. <i>Treu Heinrich</i><a class="noteref" id="xd20e6766src"
href="#xd20e6766" name="xd20e6766src">4</a> shows the combination of
the central theme with <i>The Water of Life</i>, and can in the nature
of the case have no direct connection with the other romance stories
under consideration, even though it belongs to a class in which <i>The
Ransomed Woman</i> sometimes appears.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e6775src" href="#xd20e6775" name="xd20e6775src">5</a> In view of
these discrepancies of position with reference to compounds which are
clearly established, we are certainly not justified in assuming that
<i>The Spendthrift Knight</i> has had anything more than a superficial
relationship to <i>The Grateful Dead</i>. To make it a basis of
classification or to attach any <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155"
href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>considerable weight to its
appearance here and there would be contrary to the only safe method of
procedure, which is to follow the evidence of events in sequence rather
than isolated traits. The very fact that none of the compounds with
<i>The Poison Maiden</i> contains any such motive as this of the knight
and the tourney shows that it must be comparatively late and really an
interloper in the family.</p>
<p>As to the way by which it entered the cycle, one must conclude that
it was afloat in Europe before the thirteenth century,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e6792src" href="#xd20e6792" name="xd20e6792src">6</a>
and furnished a very natural opening for a tale in which a youth goes
into the world to seek adventure or profit. Were a lady to be won by
the help of the ghost, it would magnify the hero&rsquo;s part, if he
were given an opportunity to take some very direct share in the wooing.
So in the group of which <i>Richars</i> and <i>Sir Amadas</i> are
members the new theme supplied the means of winning a lady, which would
otherwise be lacking. In <i>Oliver</i> and <i>Lope de Vega</i> it has
perhaps supplanted the ransom of a maiden, which is the trait to be
expected, if they are rightly placed among the variants of the type
<i>The Grateful Dead</i> + <i>The Ransomed Woman</i>. It will be noted
that in the two Icelandic tales, which conform closely to the type, the
tourney does not appear. There seems to be reason, therefore, for
supposing that the new material touched our central theme at least
twice, combining with the prototype of the <i>Amadas</i> group and of
the Icelandic folk-stories. The authors of <i>Oliver</i> and <i>Treu
Heinrich</i> may have adopted it consciously, and so these variants
should be left out of account.</p>
<p>Before leaving the matter, however, it must be noted that in
<i>Tobit</i> the hero leaves home on account of the poverty of his
father to seek the help of a relative. The ever-recurring possibility
of a recollection of <i>Tobit</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156"
href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>on the part of the European
story-tellers<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6836src" href="#xd20e6836"
name="xd20e6836src">7</a> should not be forgotten. To argue that the
suggestion of adapting <i>The Spendthrift Knight</i> was due to a
conscious or unconscious recollection of the Apocrypha would be laying
too much stress upon what can at best be nothing more than conjecture,
but there can be no harm in the surmise that such may have been the
case.</p>
<p>The matter of the division of his child or children by the hero to
fulfil the bargain made with his helper must next be discussed. This
occurs in twenty-five of the variants which we have considered, namely:
<i>Lithuanian II., Transylvanian, Lope de Vega, Oliver, Jean de Calais
I.-X., Basque II., Gaelic, Irish I., Breton I., III.</i>, and
<i>VII.</i>, <i>Simrock I., II.</i>, and <i>VIII., Sir Amadas</i>, and
<i>Factor&rsquo;s Garland</i>. With reference to one group where the
trait appears<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6860src" href="#xd20e6860"
name="xd20e6860src">8</a> I have already spoken at some length of
<i>The Two Friends</i>, and I have referred to the introduction of the
children as they have appeared in scattered variants. I now wish to
call the reader&rsquo;s attention to the general aspects of the
question. What relation has the use of this trait in versions of <i>The
Grateful Dead</i> to the theme which I call <i>The Two Friends</i>?</p>
<p>It must first be noted that the motive as it appears in <i>Amis and
Amiloun</i> requires<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6877src" href=
"#xd20e6877" name="xd20e6877src">9</a> that the hero slay his children
for the healing of his foster-brother and sworn friend. Now of the
twenty-five variants of <i>The Grateful Dead</i> just named only
<i>Oliver</i> and <i>Lope de Vega</i> have this factor,&mdash;the
others merely state that the helper asked the hero to fulfil his
bargain by giving up his only child,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e6890src" href="#xd20e6890" name="xd20e6890src">10</a> or giving
up one of his two children,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6899src" href=
"#xd20e6899" name="xd20e6899src">11</a> or dividing his only
child,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6905src" href="#xd20e6905" name=
"xd20e6905src">12</a> or dividing his three children.<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e6923src" href="#xd20e6923" name="xd20e6923src">13</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>The query at once suggests itself as to whether
the simple division of the child or children as part of the
hero&rsquo;s possessions gave rise to the introduction of the whole
theme of <i>The Two Friends</i> in <i>Oliver</i> and <i>Lope de
Vega</i>, or whether the twenty-two folk-tales have merely an echo of
the theme as there found. To put the question is almost equivalent to
answering it. One sees at once that the former is the case. <i>Lope de
Vega</i> derives directly from <i>Oliver</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e6947src" href="#xd20e6947" name="xd20e6947src">14</a> and to the
author of that romance must be due the combination of the two themes
there presented. Reference to the earlier discussion of the
variant<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6950src" href="#xd20e6950" name=
"xd20e6950src">15</a> will show that he was a conscious adapter of his
material.</p>
<p>Yet it by no means follows that the suggestion for the combination
was not present in the version of <i>The Grateful Dead</i>, which was
used in making <i>Oliver</i>. Indeed, it seems probable that this
source or prototype had the division of the child in somewhat the form
in which it appears in so many tales. That such was the case is likely
from the fact that of the twenty-two folk variants which refer to the
child all but two are of the type <i>The Grateful Dead</i> + <i>The
Ransomed Woman</i>, to which <i>Oliver</i> is approximated. Considering
the alterations which the theme was likely to suffer at the hands of a
writer who was more or less consciously combining various material in a
romance, the wonder is that the type was not more changed than it seems
to have been. In point of fact, the position of <i>Oliver</i> and its
literary successors as examples of the compound comes out more
clearly<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6974src" href="#xd20e6974" name=
"xd20e6974src">16</a> through this examination of their relationship to
<i>The Two Friends</i>.</p>
<p>As to the introduction of the child, the trait by means of which,
according to my theory, the actual combination of motives came about,
the two folk-tales of the type <i>The Grateful Dead</i> + <i>The Poison
Maiden</i> as well as <i>Sir <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href=
"#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>Amadas</i>, are of great
importance. Since the great majority of the variants which have the
child belong clearly to the compound type with <i>The Ransomed
Woman</i>, it is only by reference to these three that one can say with
assurance that the modified trait indicates no vital connection with
<i>The Two Friends</i>. Yet with these in mind there can be little
doubt about the matter. The story-tellers have simply extended the
division of the hero&rsquo;s possessions from property and wife to
child, a process perhaps made easier by the existence of such stories
as <i>The Child Vowed to the Devil</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e7002src" href="#xd20e7002" name="xd20e7002src">17</a> and some
forms of the <i>Souhaits Saint Martin</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e7011src" href="#xd20e7011" name="xd20e7011src">18</a> This might
have happened to any particular variant with equal facility. At the
same time, the fact that the change was made in only three cases
outside the group, which has <i>The Ransomed Woman</i> in combination,
gives that family additional solidarity.</p>
<p>In <i>Oliver, Lope de Vega</i>, and <i>Sir Amadas</i> the motive of
<i>The Spendthrift Knight</i> appears together with the change or
combination just referred to. At first sight, it might appear that
there was some essential connection between these two elements foreign
to the main theme. Such does not seem to be the case, however, when the
matter is further considered. At any rate, I am unable to discover any
such link, and am inclined to ascribe the simultaneous appearance of
these two factors to chance pure and simple. Neither one is more than a
rather late and comparatively unimportant phenomenon as far as <i>The
Grateful Dead</i> is concerned.</p>
<p>Not infrequently in the course of this study attention has been
called to the substitution of a beast for the helping friend of the
hero, and in a few cases to the transference of the ghost&rsquo;s
entire r&ocirc;le to an animal. While considering matters of greater
importance, it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>seemed best to ignore this in order to avoid
unnecessary confusion. The matter is of considerable importance,
however, and must here be considered. The question that concerns us is
whether the appearance of the beast is of any real moment in the
development of the theme.</p>
<p>It is sufficiently clear that the well-known stories of grateful
animals and ungrateful men, which were first traced by Benfey,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e7041src" href="#xd20e7041" name=
"xd20e7041src">19</a> have general outlines different from that of
<i>The Grateful Dead</i>. Benfey&rsquo;s contention, however, that
&ldquo;<span lang="de">konnte der Gedanke von der Dankbarkeit der
Thiere schon tief genug auch im Occident einwurzeln, um auch in andere
M&auml;rchen einzudringen und vielleicht selbst sich in Bildung von
verwandten zur Anschauung zu bringen</span>&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e7052src" href="#xd20e7052" name="xd20e7052src">20</a> should
be kept in mind. This statement is truer than his later remark<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e7055src" href="#xd20e7055" name=
"xd20e7055src">21</a> that fairies and other superhuman creations of
fancy are substituted for animals, instancing our theme as such a case.
To argue relationship from the entrance of either helpful beasts,
fairies, or ghosts would be dangerous unless the stories in question
had the same motive, since they are so frequently found in
folk-literature. Indeed, as I have already remarked,<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e7059src" href="#xd20e7059" name="xd20e7059src">22</a> one is
scarcely called upon to explain the intrusion of thankful or helpful
animals at any given point, in view of the fact that the device is
almost universally known. Yet if it does not require justification, it
may well be of service in the grouping of particular variants.</p>
<p>It is certainly worthy of notice that in eighteen forms of <i>The
Grateful Dead</i> a beast appears. That these are of several different
compound types would show, if it were not clear from what has been said
above, that the appearance of an animal furnishes of itself no evidence
of any actual amalgamation of narrative themes. It is rather a case
where one stock figure of imagination&rsquo;s realm is substituted for
another. The better-known character is perhaps more likely to replace
the less-known <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>than <i>vice versa</i>, but the latter event may
happen if the obscurer figure will serve to enliven the tale.</p>
<p>Of the twenty variants in our cycle which have a thankful beast,
<i>Jewish</i> has the simple theme; <i>Servian IV.</i> the combination
with <i>The Poison Maiden</i>; <i>Jean de Calais II., VII.</i>, and
<i>X., Simrock II., III., V.</i>, and <i>VIII.</i>, and
<i>Oldenburgian</i> the combination with <i>The Ransomed Woman</i>; and
<i>Walewein, Lotharingian, Tuscan, Brazilian, Basque I.</i>, <i>Breton
IV., V.</i>, and <i>VI.</i>, and <i>Simrock IX.</i> the combination
with <i>The Water of Life</i>.</p>
<p>Now in Jewish<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7117src" href="#xd20e7117"
name="xd20e7117src">23</a> the hero is saved from shipwreck<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e7120src" href="#xd20e7120" name=
"xd20e7120src">24</a> by a stone, carried home by an eagle, and there
met by a white-clad man, who explains the earlier appearances. This is
mere reinforcement of the tale by triplication, and implies nothing
more than a certain vigour of imagination on the part of the
story-teller. In <i>Servian IV.</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e7138src" href="#xd20e7138" name="xd20e7138src">25</a> where the
hero spares a fish which he has caught, there appears, on the contrary,
to be actual combination with <i>The Thankful Beasts</i> as a motive.
The fish comes on the scene in human form, and fulfils the part of the
grateful dead till the very end, when it leaps back into its element.
As for the variants of the compound type with <i>The Ransomed Woman</i>
there is considerable diversity, yet all of them have merely
substitution, not combination. So in <i>Jean de Calais II., VII.</i>
and <i>X.</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7154src" href="#xd20e7154"
name="xd20e7154src">26</a> which are closely allied with other members
of the group so named, the beast appears, but in one case as a white
bird, in the second as a fox, and in the third as a crow. That this is
anything more than a substitution due to the story-teller&rsquo;s
individuality cannot be admitted, though knowledge of <i>The Thankful
Beasts</i> as a motive is not barred out. <i>Simrock II.</i> and
<i>VIII.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd20e7166src" href="#xd20e7166"
name="xd20e7166src">27</a> are likewise nearly related to one another
and to <i>Jean de <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161"
name="pb161">161</a>]</span>Calais</i>, and they have the same
adventitious substitution. <i>Simrock V.</i> and <i>Oldenburgian</i>
are a similar pair,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7180src" href=
"#xd20e7180" name="xd20e7180src">28</a> while <i>Simrock
III.</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7187src" href="#xd20e7187" name=
"xd20e7187src">29</a> which is otherwise allied to <i>Bohemian</i>,
cannot be shown to have any vital connection with <i>The Thankful
Beasts</i> as a motive. Of all these tales it can be said that they
show some influence from such a theme without actual combination.
Finally, all the variants of the type <i>The Grateful Dead</i> + <i>The
Water of Life</i>, which have the animal substituted,<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e7203src" href="#xd20e7203" name="xd20e7203src">30</a> belong
to a well-defined and centralized group<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e7206src" href="#xd20e7206" name="xd20e7206src">31</a> which has
had independent existence for centuries. Here the entrance of the beast
is of considerable importance to the classification and development of
the theme.</p>
<p>Of the part which <i>The Thankful Beasts</i> as a motive has played
in connection with <i>The Grateful Dead</i> it must be said that, on
the whole, it has been of very secondary importance. It illustrates, as
do <i>The Spendthrift Knight</i> and <i>The Two Friends</i>, how one
current theme may touch and even influence another at several different
points without becoming embodied with it. This trait or that may be
absorbed as the motives meet, yet the two waves may go their way
without mingling. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In considering the general development and relations
of <i>The Grateful Dead</i>, to which we must now turn, it is proper to
inquire first of all as to its origin. Hitherto the existence of the
story-theme as such has been taken well nigh for granted, though the
discussion of variants in simple form necessitated some
reference<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7234src" href="#xd20e7234" name=
"xd20e7234src">1</a> to the point of separation between the <i lang=
"de">m&auml;rchen</i> and whatever beliefs or social customs lie
beyond. Now that the tale has been followed through its various
modifications and has been proved by a systematic study of its forms to
be, if I may use the expression, a living organism, the debateable land
outside can be entered with measurable security.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that <i>The Grateful Dead</i> as a theme is
based upon beliefs about the sacred duty of burial and upon the customs
incident to withholding burial for the sake of revenge or recompense.
To study these phenomena in detail is not necessary to the scheme of
this book, but belongs rather to the province of primitive religion and
law. It is sufficient for our purpose to show the nature and extent of
such observances and beliefs for the sake of the light which they may
throw on the genesis of the tale itself.</p>
<p>The belief that no obligation is more binding on man than that he
pay proper respect to the dead is as old as civilization itself.
Indeed, it probably antedates what <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163"
href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>we ordinarily call
civilization, since otherwise it could not well be found so widely
distributed over the earth in historical times. It evidently rests upon
the notion that the soul, when separated from the body, could find no
repose.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7249src" href="#xd20e7249" name=
"xd20e7249src">2</a> Herodotus tells<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e7255src" href="#xd20e7255" name="xd20e7255src">3</a> of the
Egyptian law, which permitted a man to give his father&rsquo;s body in
pledge, with the proviso that if he failed to repay the loan neither he
nor any of his kin could be buried at all. The story, also related by
Herodotus,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7258src" href="#xd20e7258" name=
"xd20e7258src">4</a> of Rampsinit and the thief which turns on the
latter&rsquo;s successful attempt to rescue his brother&rsquo;s body,
illustrates again the value that the Egyptians set upon burial. Their
notion seems to have been that the more honour paid the dead, the more
bearable would be their lot, though it was regarded as unenviable at
best.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7261src" href="#xd20e7261" name=
"xd20e7261src">5</a> Among the Magi of Persia, though both burial and
burning were prohibited because of the sanctity of earth and fire, the
bodies of the dead were cared for according to the strictest of codes,
being left to the sun and air on elevated structures.<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e7271src" href="#xd20e7271" name="xd20e7271src">6</a> In India
the <i>Rig-Veda</i><a class="noteref" id="xd20e7278src" href=
"#xd20e7278" name="xd20e7278src">7</a> bears witness to similar
carefulness in the performance of this sacred duty.</p>
<p>In classical times belief in the necessity of proper burial was
widespread. Patroclus, it will be remembered, appears to his friend
Achilles, and admonishes him that he should not neglect the dead, at
the same time giving a dire picture of the state of the
unburied.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7283src" href="#xd20e7283" name=
"xd20e7283src">8</a> Pausanias speaks<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e7288src" href="#xd20e7288" name="xd20e7288src">9</a> of the

Philocles and the four thousand slain at Aegospotami, saying that the
Athenians did as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164"
name="pb164">164</a>]</span>much for the Medes after Marathon, and even
Xerxes for the Lacedaemonians after Thermopylae. The story told by
Cicero<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7293src" href="#xd20e7293" name=
"xd20e7293src">10</a> of Simonides gives definite proof of the concrete
nature of the reverential feeling among both Greeks and Romans.
Suetonius in his life of Caligula relates that when the emperor&rsquo;s
body was left half burned and unburied, ghosts filled the palace and
garden.</p>
<p>An example of the mediaeval belief is found in the Middle High
German <i>Kudrun</i>, written at the end of the twelfth century or the
beginning of the thirteenth.</p>

<p class="first">The <i>Annamite</i> tale cited in the third
chapter<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7325src" href="#xd20e7325" name=
"xd20e7325src">12</a> and <i>Servian VI.</i>, likewise summarized in
connection with variants having the story-theme in simple
form,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7331src" href="#xd20e7331" name=
"xd20e7331src">13</a> bear witness to the effect that the widespread
belief has had upon folk-tales now in circulation. The connection of
these two tales with the <i>m&auml;rchen</i> as such is so vague that
they serve the end of illustrating its growth from popular belief
rather than the relationship of one form to another. So also the story
from Brittany, printed by S&eacute;billot,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e7338src" href="#xd20e7338" name="xd20e7338src">14</a> which tells
how a ghost came to workmen in a mill demanding Christian interment for
its body then buried under the foundations, serves the same end, though
no reward is mentioned. Sometimes the neglect of burial by a person
brings unpleasant results to him, as is witnessed by a tale from
Guernsey.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7343src" href="#xd20e7343" name=
"xd20e7343src">15</a> A fisherman neglected <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>to
bury a body which he encountered on the coast, and, when he reached his
home, found the ghost awaiting him. An Indian tale illustrates the
belief that the dead become vampires when funeral rites are not
performed.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7351src" href="#xd20e7351" name=
"xd20e7351src">16</a></p>
<p>In most versions of <i>The Grateful Dead</i> a corpse is left
unburied either because creditors remain unpaid or the surviving
relatives cannot pay for Christian burial. From sixteenth century
Scotland we have evidence that the latter trait is based on actual
custom. Sir David Lyndesaye, in <i>The Monarche</i>, while describing
the exactions of the clergy, says:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Quhen he hes all, than, vnder his cure,</p>
<p class="line">And Father and Mother boith ar dede,</p>
<p class="line">Beg mon the babis, without remede:</p>
<p class="line">They hauld the Corps at the kirk style;</p>
<p class="line">And thare it moste remane ane quhyle,</p>
<p class="line">Tyll thay gett sufficient souerte</p>
<p class="line">For thare kirk rycht and dewite.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e7380src" href="#xd20e7380" name="xd20e7380src">17</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">This evidence for the widespread belief in the pious
duty of burial and for the custom of withholding burial in cases where
the dead man was poor, though it might easily be increased in bulk,
makes very clear at least two matters. The tale of <i>The Grateful
Dead</i> might have arisen almost anywhere and in almost any age since
the time of the Egyptians. Again, when once it had been formed, it was
likely to be reinforced or changed by the beliefs and customs prevalent
in the lands to which it came.</p>
<p>The first matter at once suggests the question as to whether, after
all, the <i lang="de">m&auml;rchen</i> has not been more than once
discovered by the imagination of story-tellers,&mdash;whether it has
not sprung up again and again in different parts of the world like
different botanical species, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href=
"#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>instead of being a single plant
which has propagated itself through many centuries. In spite of the
evident possibility that such sporadic development might have taken
place, I cannot believe that it happened so. If we had to do with some
vaguely outlined myth in which only the underlying idea was the same in
the several groups of variants, and if this vague tale were narrated
among peoples of absolutely no kinship to one another, say by the
Indians of North America and the Zulus, one could have no reasonable
doubt that similar conditions had produced similar tales. Such stories
exist in numbers sufficient to render untenable the old hypothesis of
Oriental origins in anything like the form in which it was held by
Benfey or even Cosquin.</p>
<p>In cases like that of <i>The Grateful Dead</i>, however, the matter
is entirely different. The theme is comparatively a complicated one,
and it is found only in lands whose inhabitants are connected either by
blood or by social and political intercourse.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e7400src" href="#xd20e7400" name="xd20e7400src">18</a> It has
preserved its integrity for nearly a score of centuries, though
suffering many changes of details, and a variety of combinations with
other themes. To my mind such an involved relationship as that worked
out in the preceding chapters proves conclusively that the story is
one, that the connection between variants is more than fortuitous.
Inductive logic makes the belief inevitable. Any other theory would
involve us in a bewildering net of contradictions, from which escape
could be found only in the avowal that nothing whatever can be known
about narrative development.</p>
<p>If the seemingly inevitable conclusion be accepted that <i>The
Grateful Dead</i> is an organism with a life history of its own, the
question at once suggests itself as to when and where it came into
being. As to its <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167"
name="pb167">167</a>]</span>ultimate origin, however, only a very
imperfect answer can be given. Surmise and theory are all that can aid
us here. Liebrecht was of the opinion that the story was of European
rather than Oriental origin,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7412src" href=
"#xd20e7412" name="xd20e7412src">19</a> even though he did not accept
Simrock&rsquo;s theory that it was Germanic. Notwithstanding the fact
that most variants are European, this hypothesis seems to me very
improbable. <i>Tobit</i>, the earliest variant which we
possess,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7421src" href="#xd20e7421" name=
"xd20e7421src">20</a> is distinctly Semitic in origin and colouring.
Other versions from Asia, like <i>Jewish, Armenian</i>, and
<i>Siberian</i>, though modern folk-tales, add weight to the evidence
of the apocryphal story, especially since the one last named comes from
a somewhat remote region where European narratives could not without
difficulty have much direct influence. Of course it is possible to
suppose that the theme came to the Semites from the West, and was by
them disseminated in Asia;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7434src" href=
"#xd20e7434" name="xd20e7434src">21</a> but the early date of
<i>Tobit</i> renders it unlikely that such was the case. Certainly it
is more reasonable from the evidence at hand to believe in the Oriental
origin of the <i>m&auml;rchen</i>. As to the particular region of Asia
where it was probably first related, nothing can be said with security.
Yet since there is no evidence that it has ever been known in India,
Western Asia, and perhaps the region inhabited by the Semites, may be
considered, at least tentatively, its first home.</p>
<p>The age of the theme cannot definitely be measured. It is possible,
however, to say that it must have existed at least as early as the
beginning of our era. <i>Tobit</i> is of assistance again here. As the
book is believed to have been written during the reign of Hadrian
(76&ndash;138 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>) and as it has the motive in
a compound form, which is unlikely to have arisen immediately after the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>simple story was first set afloat, there is
little danger of over-statement in saying that the latter must have
been known at least as early as the first part of first century
<span class="sc">A.D.</span>, or more probably before the birth of
Christ. Any statement beyond this would rest on idle speculation.</p>
<p>After <i>The Grateful Dead</i> was once established as a narrative,
its development can be traced with some degree of precision, though not
without many gaps here and there. Its history is largely a matter of
combinations with originally independent themes, with an occasional
landmark in the form of a literary version. The most notable compounds
into which it has entered are those with <i>The Poison Maiden, The
Ransomed Woman</i>, and certain types connected with <i>The Water of
Life</i>. That it entered into other minor compounds at various stages
gives evidence that it retained its independence long after the first
union took place, even though examples of the simple type are so hard
to find and in some cases of such doubtful character.</p>
<p>Probably the first combination of the theme was with <i>The Poison
Maiden</i>, which the valuable evidence of <i>Tobit</i> enables us to
date as taking place as early as the middle of the first century and in
western Asia. <i>The Poison Maiden</i> probably came originally from
India by way of Persia,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7483src" href=
"#xd20e7483" name="xd20e7483src">22</a> and was certainly widely
distributed. Among the Semites it would naturally first meet any tale
which had other than Indian origin, so that the existence of
<i>Tobit</i> at so early a date is only what one would expect, looking
at the matter in this retrospective fashion. The amalgamation of these
two themes, when once they had come into the same region, was natural.
They had the necessary point of contact in the treatment of the
hero&rsquo;s wife by a helpful friend, who played an important part in
each. In <i>The Poison Maiden</i> she <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb169" href="#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span>received short
shrift, being possessed of a poisonous glance or bite, or of snakes
ready to destroy the man who married her.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e7495src" href="#xd20e7495" name="xd20e7495src">23</a> In <i>The
Grateful Dead</i> she was innocent, but had to be divided to satisfy
the claims of a being who had helped her husband.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e7501src" href="#xd20e7501" name="xd20e7501src">24</a> The part of
the friend was less well motivated in <i>The Poison Maiden</i> than in
<i>The Grateful Dead</i>, so that it was natural for the themes to
unite at a common point and produce a compound at once more complete
and more thrilling than were the simpler forms. This combination must
have been made not by a conscious literary worker, for, had it been,
<i>Tobit</i> would surely stand less independent of the later versions
than is actually the case, but by the tellers of folk-tales, in a
manner quite unconscious and altogether unstudied. The stories combined
of themselves, so to say.</p>
<p>From Semitic lands, if it was indeed there made, the compound seems
to have travelled into Europe as well as into other parts of
Asia.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7516src" href="#xd20e7516" name=
"xd20e7516src">25</a> It has spread during the intervening centuries
throughout the length and breadth of Europe, always remaining a
genuinely popular tale. As far as my knowledge goes, it did not appear
in literature from the time when the Hebrew book of <i>Tobit</i> was
written till Peele&rsquo;s <i>Old Wives&rsquo; Tale</i> was presented
some fifteen centuries later on the English stage. In the nineteenth
century it again appeared to the reading public in the version which
the Dane Andersen made from a Norse folk-tale. Yet the story in all
versions of the compound extant is unmistakably the same, though it has
suffered more changes in detail than would be worth while to enumerate
here, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>since they have already been noted in the
chapter dealing with the type. The most important modification which it
sustained was due to its meeting <i>The Lady and the Monster</i> and
absorbing elements of that tale. How early this took place it is
impossible to say, since George Peele&rsquo;s play is the only literary
monument that helps to fix any date. A considerable stretch of time
must, however, be allowed for the passage of a folk-tale from the
extreme east of Europe to England. That the secondary combination was
indeed made in eastern Europe admits of definite proof. All the known
variants of <i>The Grateful Dead</i> + <i>The Poison Maiden</i> from
the west have <i>The Lady and the Monster</i> as well, while three
Slavic east-European versions<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7545src" href=
"#xd20e7545" name="xd20e7545src">26</a> are of this type. It follows
that the compound must have been formed in the east and carried to the
west, since otherwise the distribution should be precisely the opposite
of that which obtains. Moreover, had the compound been made in Asia, it
is improbable that it would have left such a comparatively feeble trace
in the eastern part of the continent of Europe and later have conquered
all the west. Other combinations, primary and secondary, have also
arisen; but, if the collection of variants hitherto made is at all
adequate, they are of inconsiderable importance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the simple theme of <i>The Grateful Dead</i> passed into
Europe by other paths. Once over the border, it met a tale with which
it readily combined, producing a type not less influential than the one
just mentioned. This new motive was <i>The Ransomed Woman</i>, the
origin of which is at present quite unknown. Though it is seemingly
Oriental in character, all versions yet unearthed come from Europe, so
that its <i>provenance</i> must be left in uncertainty. At all events,
it was known in eastern Europe, and it was there in all probability
that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>it became amalgamated with <i>The Grateful
Dead</i>. How early this took place cannot be stated, but long enough
before the fourteenth century to allow the passage of the compound type
to France by that time, when it was retold by Gobius with a good deal
of mutilation in his <i>Scala Celi</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e7572src" href="#xd20e7572" name="xd20e7572src">27</a> The points
of contact, which led to the combination, have already been discussed
in the chapter dealing with the type.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e7575src" href="#xd20e7575" name="xd20e7575src">28</a> Suffice it
to say at this point that they were, in brief, the journey of the hero,
his rescue, and the wife whom he gained at the end of the story. As in
the case of <i>The Poison Maiden</i>, the compound seems to have arisen
quite naturally by means of these correspondences, with the end of
making a more romantic and satisfactory tale. That it took place quite
unconsciously seems clear, but that the result was successful is proved
by the solidarity of the type thus produced, though it has subsequently
been carried into every part of Europe. The relationship of versions,
between thirty and forty in number, is unmistakable.</p>
<p>That the simple motive of <i>The Grateful Dead</i> was not exhausted
by the two remarkable combinations just treated, that it retained its
individuality and independence, is shown by the various minor
combinations discussed in the third chapter. It is altogether probable
that other examples of such simple compounds as those containing <i>The
Swan-Maiden, Puss in Boots</i>, and a story like that told of Pope
Gregory<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7589src" href="#xd20e7589" name=
"xd20e7589src">29</a> are in existence, and may be found by later
study. One can speak only with reference to material at command. Very
likely other combinations than those treated here are in existence and
may also appear, either in sporadic cases or in groups. But, the reader
may ask, if the motive is found in so many compounds, both with and
without <i>The Poison Maiden</i> and <i>The Ransomed Woman</i>, why
does it not occur <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172"
name="pb172">172</a>]</span>more frequently, at least in
folk-literature, without combination? To this I should reply that the
story is an ancient one, which has many points of correspondence with
other themes. By reason of these traits it has absorbed, or has been
absorbed by, these other tales, until now it is difficult to find
examples of the simple form. A thousand years ago, or some such matter,
they may, indeed, have been frequently retold by the firesides of
Europe, though now they are practically unknown. The constant tendency
of folk-tales to change from simplicity to complexity would in time
cause the pure theme to be generally forgotten. Nevertheless, its
existence could be proved, even though no example still remained, for
the various independent compounds would be inexplicable on any other
theory. In the case of <i>The Grateful Dead</i>, the tales, to which it
has been joined, have been so interwoven with its substance that it is
quite impossible to believe, for example, that the combination with
<i>The Ransomed Woman</i> proceeded from that with <i>The Poison
Maiden</i>.</p>
<p>But these simple compounds with a single foreign theme do not
complete the tale. When once they were formed, they in turn had each a
history of its own, with infinite possibilities of absorbing traits
from other stories or even entire themes. In the case of the latter, a
reason could always be found in such points of contact as I have
already mentioned, or so I believe, if the material were sufficient for
proper comparison. In this way arose the complicated types treated in
chapter six, where the manner of combination is readily seen.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e7612src" href="#xd20e7612" name=
"xd20e7612src">30</a> Sometimes, it is probable, subtraction has taken
place as well as addition, but apparently only when it has not involved
the disentangling of various traits. For example, many variants have
been noted where one of the two most striking features of our central
theme, the burial <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173"
name="pb173">173</a>]</span>of the dead debtor, has disappeared; yet in
every case the rest of the plot has remained unimpaired. The more
complicated the variant, the better able is the investigator to place
its kinship to other variants, provided that he has the requisite
material and the patience to follow up the clues that every such
labyrinth affords.</p>
<p>The most striking facts of general import to the study of
folk-narrative that have developed in the course of this prolonged
consideration of <i>The Grateful Dead</i> may be briefly summarized in
conclusion. It has been shown once again that the story has an organic
life of its own, whether it comes from the East or the West, whether it
be founded upon some fact of social custom or belief, or on the
imaginings of a moralist of antiquity.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e7623src" href="#xd20e7623" name="xd20e7623src">31</a> Once
started, it will go its way through divers lands and ages, yet retain
unaltered the essential features of its plot. Call it story-skeleton,
or better, living organism, it always keeps its structural integrity,
no matter whether told as a pious legend or a <i lang="fr">conte
&agrave; rire</i>. Of no less importance than this is the fact that
whatever serious changes take place in its form are not fortuitous,
mere whimsical alterations due to the fancy of story-tellers, but are
due to capabilities of expansion or combination in the plot itself.
Whenever two themes with points of resemblance, or contact come into
the same region, they are in the long run pretty certain to unite, each
retaining its individuality, but merging in the other. This principle
is well illustrated in the history of <i>The Grateful Dead</i>. The
marriages of stories seem never to be merely for convenience, except in
the hands of conscious writers, but to be the result of attraction and
real compatibility. That, I take it, is why and how narratives
develop.</p>
<p>Were it necessary to justify such studies as the present,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>one might add that, apart from helping to the
settlement of such more general questions as those just mentioned, they
throw light on the sources of particular literary works, better than
does the haphazard search for parallels, and they often enable the
student to see the relations between the literatures of neighbouring
countries more clearly than he would be able to do without the
perspective gained by a comparative consideration of a single theme in
many lands. In ways like these the author hopes that this history of
<i>The Grateful Dead</i> may be serviceable.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
